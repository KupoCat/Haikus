My dark passenger / The monster beneath the man / Rises after dusk
Blind man's eyes open / To see a sky in colour / Not a Cockerell crows

A morning haiku
Drive past shaded yews / Sharp light, turn my head to view / How did I get home?
Don't make seas out of / Rivers, lost in the hourglass / Though hardships we face
Between man and beast/Crucial distinction is lost/When blood is scented

Lesbian bed death / is real. Weeks, months, years, I / just need a good f*ck.
My heart hurts again / With Alanis on repeat / Best breakup goddess
Roaring into March / icicles on his mane with / the lamb in his jaws

First, drowning in text / Eventually, swimming / Finally, informed
Moon shines on thick frost, / the winter world still slumbers, / my lonely arms ache.
Definition of Business?
So, now you're sorry? / We discussed the end was near, / still you did nothing.
This place in my heart, the grander days it has seen, peeling from the walls.
My trimmer cut the / cable to communicate / the bugs on a web
A sperm makes contact/ It's million siblings passing/ Into the blackness
remember old me, who use to always listen, they will go deaf too.
Walk Away
What is art, you ask / There's no real definition / Art. It's a question
Tight pickle jar please / Now I wrench I jar I squeeze / Please open. For me?
Your head on my chest / We listen; my beat, your breath / Slowly out of sync
Springtime stream swells, lush / New life to dry soil and roots / Smiled at me today.
Your life is fucked up / who am I to criticize / I’m right behind you
I drown on dry land / reassure me it’s worth it / as I gasp again
I lay in darkness / with the silence to comfort / what tomorrow brings
Longer days spark joy. / Daylight when I go to work / and when I come home.
A Haiku D'état - Revolution of Being, to Repetition of Theme
Halyards high fiving / the mast while jib and main are / trimmed in victory
My first hakiu
Conceptual band / violins and violas / named it String Theory
Went digging for gold / I came up empty handed / but did find a vein
The sting of the cane, biting deep into my flesh, all for her pleasure.
Tinder cracking near. / Snow slows then sticks around me. / Sat. my headphones pulse.
Summer’s warmth was ours / Distant space, more space, than more / Chilled sheets clinch my chest
My child’s birthday laugh / Seasons seen running them past / My joy is for theirs
Inches, feet, or miles; / it's all the same because I / cannot touch you.
A boy and balloon / rolling happily when they're / both tied to a chair
those dolphins and whales/do they really think of us/like we think of them
all of the old gods/periodically kill/with fire and water
Planes and trains arrive / An agreement yet to come / High road untraveled
Christmas comes early / on The Hill and in The News / Expose the POTUS

Chairs turned to the South / Take a seat, now run and jump! / Dimples from laughter
Boomers successful/Children get educated/No home, student debt

My Battery Is/ Low, Its Getting Dark, I Don't/ Feel Good, Mr. Stark
Slave, Number 213/ capitalist life is pain/ another 10 hours
She counted her worth / Not by those she helped or loved / But pounds and measures
Imagine my shock / the blood all left my body / where could it have gone?
Pancakes for breakfast
In my 4th decade, / but I still feel like a kid; / clueless, awkward, strange.
Netflix, the couch, my / pup, PJs, a blanket, and / wine, cant forget wine.
I wish I could find / a man as cool as my cat / guess I’ll keep looking
Some think I’m just rude / but I’m not, I swear to you / I’m just genuine
An oxymoron / but I’m too tired to sleep / in my plaid long shorts
You hold in your hand / all the answers you could want / if you believe it
My house is cluttered/ Like my mind with memories/ That I cannot clean
Why do you downvote / a decent haiku? Are you / jealous of real skills?
Just watched the Oscars / No one was running the show / Much like the White House
Long is the night sky ~ Strong and steady Orion ~ Guide the way my friend!
All life lives scantly/From this, we must deviate/Live upon the dash
Effacing her name / at a pigment parlor to / Freedom USA
Head is filled with bees/ Bees waiting to be released/ Release lies ahead
Today's mood.
This field is now gone. Earth ground into concrete flour. Hope blown on the wind.
Dream awake, your fate/running makeup, tears today/my memories traced
Union with her sun / an elevated host is / the reflective moon
Its a tanka... Alone in your bed, / resting me head where you do; / breathing in your scent. // This moment, embraced by your / sheets, I feel so close to you.
My thoughts consumed by / fabricated memories; / you and I in bed.
God doesn't exist - he can't/ That old lady wouldn't look so lonely if he did/ Nor I feel so.

"It's late, but you free?" / Two hearts illuminated / Full moon, spring is here
Freezing wind howling/ The branches bare and blackened/ Tomorrow flowers
weekend laundry like / i will feel so accomplished / but did not do much
Your love is a drug / When I see you I can fly / I wish it was real
Goals as a father / teach please and thank you, also, / don't fuck with people
Rainy snowy days/I got sunshine by the bag/a short term escape
"There's three minutes left..." / Selfie; "...drunk on Jim Steinman..." / "Stop fuckin' playing..."
Time to surrender/everything you want and love/all that you regret
Sunset warms my face / Summer breeze tangles your hair / Our fingers entwined
Man and the Machine / How are you today? but just / spits out a receipt
Bacon on my plate / Wait , what? No that's not bacon / What did I just eat?
Invincible now/unstoppable, world is mine/power of powder
Haiku;
The entrance buzzed while / antennae saluting was / admitting their stripes
It's like a nicked vein / Bleeding, unable to stop / Iron mixed with salt
Haiku; master's stroke / with a few flicks of a pen / heart strings can be plucked
Karl Marx wrote a book / Communist Manifesto / I am soviet
Winter months drag on/ Snowmen, sledding, snowball fights/ It's not quite so bad
Hardest thing in life / taking a few steps back and / letting them be wrong
In the Swiss Army / Can and bottle openers / Are the ones most used
A Japanese style/of short poem which consists of/just seventeen beats
Embryonic crawl / to a marsupial mom / for Kanga, Love Roo
Melancholia, / restless agony plagues me. / Comfort eludes me.
I could lock my door / Shatter the office window / Freedom for five floors
When I learned Morse code / I couldn't get restful sleep / The rain kept talking
My grey matter splits / now black and white on the page / a story is told
Pen, paper, and ink / come together to create / This. My trinity.
Before you ramble / If you can't read my silence / Then you are nothing
Starfish
Skin so tan and taut /Bang you till the break of dawn /Love in every beat
Dirty hippy smells / patchouli, hemp, sandalwood / barefoot, hacky-sack
Sun is out schorching/ cooking eggs on the pavement/ true playas only
Northern alarm clocks / 5 a.m. scraping and the / rumbling snow plow trucks
Fragrant tendrils twirl / Nag champa burns steadily / Inhale peace of mind
worn like an old wheel/rolls along like a river/but seldom it roars
Somewhere in the world / Someone is building a chair / Someone else is dead.
Hillside of flowers / stretching for countless miles / but not yet in bloom
There are only six/ You heard me, SIX Taco Bells/ In all of Japan
Reserved for Speaker / a Robin's oratory / gave a trilling speech
Like a house of cards/ My cultivated habits/ Have fallen apart
#6
Rain was coming down/Happiness and joy no more/Then you come along...
Pink clouds on blue sky / Reflecting the moon's daylight / Night round the corner
My head's in the clouds, / my mind is in the gutter; / I must have a crush.
A realm of wonder / so much beauty to behold / a whole life ahead
Birds of paradise/ Violently shake in the storm/ Just like my heartstrings
like watching waves crash/not one grain of sand complains/dense blank thuds echo
So fat and fluffy / Love me a cat on my lap / great for a small nap
I miss you brother/ It’s been lonely without you/ Can’t we just go back?
Vaccines cause autism / Man made climate change is fake / The Earth is flat too!
Hypnotized/memories, your name/illusion
My cat is dying /All I can do is to cry / Farewell my dear friend
Procrastinators / Wash-n-Dry equality / in our jammy pants
In the moment life/no thoughts about tomorrow/nervous lip trembles
"Maybe I'll see you"/ But I didn't hear "maybe"/ Instead I heard "no."
Mountains topped with Snow/ Here I gaze upon the Sky/ My Azure Canvas
You’ll feel really good./Then everything will go dark/and then you’ll turn blue.
Don't want to forget / a single moment of time / we spent together.
I birthed your babies / I lied for you when needed / I took your abuse
Snowy day / - I'm glad laughter like that / still exists
Creating deceit/ These people thrive in the dark/ With flying monkeys
Handfuls of roses/Fingers bloodied by the thorns/Each drop is a gift.
As you un-stoned/ where the cold moonlight was thrown/I sat, crumbling.
An emergency? / It's just another day when / I don't get my way
This sad sinking ship/ where I have lived and will die/‘neath your broken wing.
She's getting closer/I can taste it in her smile/remain close. Wait. Still.
Strength is wearing thin / your touch, your smell, your smile... / Harder to say no.
All things will abide / As the water of the tide: / Coming, going; thus.
Everyone lived there/ Suspended in a Sunbeam/ On a mote of dust
A series of haikus made for DnD characters
Hey you over there! - With your dark hair and bright eyes - Have we met before?
dewy grass glistens / brightly, radiating sun / lighting up the land
It ain’t so bad, Kid/ Until you get bent over/ And can’t bend straight then.
Big Emergency / Guys I need some help right now / Mom found the poop sock
Follow the leader/ Not who says what he has done/ But who does what's said
Easing down their flaps / Air Canada has landed / safely with a honk
Oh to be sober/ in a world full of drunks/ is to be loveless
Between the pillow/ and the vast parental sky/ lost uncounted sheep.
Rumi once wrote words / So deep that they were shallow / So sharp they were blunt
Been a few days since / I posted here, a haiku​ / I have felt better.
Don't know how to live / Hang on to whatever hope / Falling through the sky
glory unstrapped, freed / big wiggling jigglers / to motorboat squeeze
If instead of bombs, we had dropped whiskey and porn, they would be allies.
Three in the morning / Times ticking by, as I scroll / I'm craving for sleep
The cold of Winter / As tangible as a knife / Dissolved by Spring's warmth
Sun on the fields/England awakes from winter/Spring is upon us
Their winter game of / I'm King of the Mountain! is / played in parking lots
Sleep is resourceful/ She turns tables to pillows/ During maths exams
Hey sleep...
Ready, aim, write!
Inner peace and happy
Sitting on a bench, / Joyful. Sunshine on my face / Brave robin warbles
How do people still / Make original haikus / you'd think we'd run out
Only time can heal/ The notion that we're alone/ Find peace within you
She loves another/ As the others said before/ I was lost in you
love makes me weary/ left out in the cold of night/ with the dogs of yore
The heart drowns today/ Forgotten in my sorrow/ Lost within my past
A teasing Solstice / unveiling bare limbs with the / leaves fluttering off
Foot in a puddle / A forgotten parking lot / Good place to daydream
I rolled all your socks / folded your clean underwear / happy valentines
sunshine through fog / silhouetted tree branches / long grass grey with dew
Opportunity / Two months to fifteen years / A fallen hero
Adrift between states / Diesel cuts through mountain air / Spark, drag, breath. Home.
Salt stains on suede shoes / sweaters soaked by soggy snow / winter's welcome wanes.
Make your bed with care/ As you'll lie in it later/ Monsters fear routine
Like the snow that fell/ This place was once unblemished/ Now just sludge remains
Heavenly fragrance / Drifts through mild breeze, what is it? / Ah! Hyacinth blooms
Heyit's no poet, Shepherds dance on Chinese nails, Tralfamadoric.
Orange Fuji slopes / The disgraced samurai kneels / Sword agleam with blood.
Oh! So wonderful,/Camellia blossoms richly/early spring sunshine
I was at my ebb/when we met. It was good but/you were at your peak.
the great true master / beginner from beginning / empty cup retains
grumpy I awoke/on this cold frost morning/need a cup of tea
Any more sense left now? / I could not say, feeling blank. / Maybe I’m just tired.
The future's opaque / the past, poorly remembered / only every now.
Snapping her gum was / a splintering of spines which / popped on the transit
A smile shows joy/ Forgotten troubles of life/ A smile masks pain
Life is just a loop/everything comes and goes/love is no different
what is learned and made / revealing meaning in life / for Humanity
Kids think they know more/ Now they see less but know more/ Their youth is no more
I Prometheus/ My Eagle is this Work Place/ Torment Eternal
Tasks
My rational side / rides shotgun, windows down with / the radio on
Power with patience, I seek stillness mindfully, My breath creates space.
Not knowing life/ Curse of Guilt/ Ignorance is Bliss.
Perfect Winter Day
We stand together / people we do not know. Now / We fight together
leaves and branches thrash/about in harsh thunderstorm/roots in ground are still
I have a sickness / I can’t get a comfy sleep / diarrhoea sucks
great again! and free! / conveniently forget slaves / make america
There was a hedgehog
Bottle
A fire in the snow / flamed against the feeder for / his sunflower seeds
You offer samples/ of foods you haven't tasted/ Practice what you preach
This day is unwell /Terrifying sensation / The sweats and fever
all the bees and trees / won't lament even briefly / human extinction
A dark, vast abyss / I jump in with my eyes closed / What a sensation!
A scudding ceiling tonight
New growth quickly blooms / Only to be whisked away / By Winter's cold wind.
Here I lie, crying / Alone as per usual / My tears are hidden
Epiphany
platinum sky shines/indigo depth glistening/ suns rays; bright, white, cold
Invisible hand / That one finger you raise up / the poor clearly see
cup of tea simply/ steaming in shaft of sunlight/ magnificent scent
Autumn and harvest / One is fall; the other, felled / Same and different
All of my regrets / were transformed into blessings / the day you were born.
Tears of saltiness / Rolling down my fragile cheek / At least I can feel
Fools know many things/the wise know but sweet nothing/open eyes, truth seen
The Emperor's Clothes / paraded as writing the / see-through poetry
(2017-0205): You seem happier / You can't lie to me Oscar / Am your spirit mouse
synthetic kinship / reasonably priced pleasure / not quite ecstasy
Perhaps this hobby / constraining feelings, in verse / has reached its Autumn
Even though, you are / millions of miles away / I hope you see this!
a footprint in mud/is it at all permanent?/shall it fade away?
Ink stains blank paper / Rich illustrations of word / Each page, a mirror
for the second day/ passing by a blooming bud/ how continuous?
You were nice to me / When I had no faith in me / I want to say thanks
Why do I do this?/ 13 weeks until exams/ Yet I choose Reddit
Their Saturday bath / had left a ring of dirt and / some floating feathers
I've lied to myself/ So I make this pledge to truth/ "Later" begins now
I stand off the cliff / I float in mid-air​ waiting, / waiting to fall down
Something is changing / and it might be the seasons / or it might be me
Friday, 1906 #7
Friday, 1906
The morningstar dared/So he was cast down burning/ To weep in absence
Faith is holding firm / while walking on water and / believing in ice
Madness afoot: Peace you wolf of hell /Choke back your bile and venom / Blister your own throat
insolence pervades / so reprimand my buttocks / don't spare the rattan
In the err of youth/I once killed a sparrow/Ironic I can't fly
Slyph
cool shades of sunrise / paint the early morning sky / the city's all mine
I killed my father/ and blindly wed my mother/ I am Oedipus
crashed my fucking car / drunk and high at arraignment / winning! tiger blood!
The sweet flowers bloom/ to be frozen in winter/ yet woman lives on
We, too, would see far / if on giants' shoulders stood / but we bear their soles
Eagle, seeing, turns / water fowl scatter and dive / One more becomes lunch

I have no strings on me~
Some old Haiku's I wrote
Book Cover
The shadow play was / silhouetted censor cat / chasing motion mouse
A man’s wedding ring/A woman’s leopard print dress/Winter pretender
Help me make Haiku for friend BD
snow held in pine trees\ Sun makes them give up their hold\ shimmering on distant hills.
We sat to play chess/the winner led the foxtrot/ I laid down the queen
Through the panes of glass/ The light is out of the eyes/ It shines in the heart.
A crush:
Paranoid human / fundamentals of love lost / it must be rebuild
Work afternoon: Lacking words to use/Would like to have energy/ Challenge to go on
A hydraulic lift / is spattering and hissing / confronting the dog
The gray winter sky/ Now mirrors my state of mind/ Darker each moment
Simmering sunset/ slowly seasons salty seas./ Sandy shores sing songs.
Just contemplating / the wabi-sabi of a / used Squatty Potty
Welcome to the void / Drift into black nothingness/ Time and space, dissolved
Nightly nonsense
The moon reflects me./ My bright side casts brilliance./ My dark side won’t show.

Wrote this one in high school
Shattered river ice / sews itself back together / pale scars crisscross wrists
For your protection / The identity police / are already here
Poker face laundry / concentrated couple and / the loser will fold
[NSFW] Just for good measure / Always keep a coat hanger / next to the staircase
I'll take care of you/ When you eat, I'll go hungry/ Who takes care of me?
no cold air or tunes/the spare is bald as a bat/but hey I like it
(2017-1012): That he was a storm / But not the kind you run from / Its the one you chase
Round circles...
You’re still part of me / But you are not what I need / I acknowledge you
These desires haunt me / Raiding the doors of my soul / Be still soul I’m here.
Oh you poor kitty!/Are you being neglected?/Cat rubs leg -meow
Pills, booze, broken glass/hear birds chirping, but alas/they can seize the day
gnats in my kitchen/ flying every where they can/ are they even friends?
Dragged myself to work / Awake but am scatter brained / Path least resistance
Deployed for battle / sabotaging hatred and / trenching flags in peace
Compassionate push / calming frustration in the / Samaritan snow
NSFW Your job is risky / keep gun with you while shitting / overconfidence
Wipe your tearing eye; / Does your mouth smile wide for me? / O, to laugh with you...
Autumnal Rains
I woke up groggy / Anxious reasons to stay home / I chose to be late.
Boil these dry leaves, / Pour the water in my cup. / You have spilled the tea...
The rock stands bare-faced / and wonders when it will die / like the life it sees/
Extended haiku: Spring's a nurse of war/ It heals winter's survivors/ and regroups soldiers// Summer's a.....
Beer, broth, and spices / Popped the Insta-Pot cherry / For pork roast Sunday

The 10th Commandment / broken by a Cowbird who / coveted a nest
Love is an echo/of our desire to be loved/whispered to the dark
melancholy blues / nights of tears on pillow sheets / solemn catharsis
So then I ask you / what does one do when true love / grows wings of its own
Behind me follows / the breeze sings a message / carry me away
No one looked harder / I spot wolf near the village / No one believed me
Lesser fear of sharks /Graceful creatures of the deep /You have my respect.
The Ice King cometh /Dealing death where life once stood / Our saviour Jon Snow
Lightheaded I fell / the Earth rose to welcome me / my first cigarette
What is a raindrop / but a single metaphor / for my fall to earth
The neon district / a lightning bug wink while they / solicit a mate
A starch collar is / strangling the city in a / freezing winter fit
Old Man Winter is / showing shabbiness while the / thread-bare grass pokes through
Tell me when and where / and for you, I will be there / twenty minutes late
Fitting new glasses Sexy ones that won’t sit right Your eyes are crooked
Life to your body/asleep,unnoticed, always/for granted, poisoned
Mighty Warrior / Quick RPG Adventure / All Told Through Haiku
Pale face heavy breath/glistening skin hot to touch/tremble, shake, gyrate
Misery detached/ Move from point A to point B/ A humble learning
Computer turned off./ I now prioritise sleep;/ Well rested at last
Blinded by the white. / Numbed to the bone by such cold. / Comfort in your love.
It has been some time/Rainclouds were discipating/The storm gets closer.
So when I awoke / I cleared my eyes, then my mind / awake, I saw you
A lifetime gone by, / finally I can cast Wish. / But what do I want?
Ticking anxiety
我意愿你/想吃你的豆腐/现在你来
See the golden sky/Ethereal, misty morn/ Apple of my eye
Dog barks at the owl/ the owl calls for a lover/ Some sounds of midnight
reaching for the stars //No backing down of yourself//fighting for control
Website parasite / the Net cast over annoy / harpooning the trolls
Old woman clears weeds/ Rekindling memories*/ Of distant childhood
I can catch most things:/ Basketballs, colds and feelings/ But not any sleep.
Mission was hindered. / Grace energized and guided. / Success then! Thanks now!
Moments full of joy/The rising sun sets the pace//time slows in this place
I survived Deadpool/ "You're not Daredevil! Sorry!"/ Amused, he spared me
The snow has fallen/my broken mind grows colder/the depth of winter.

I used to fear death / But that's when I was happy / Now I don't fear death.

Meta Haiku
I've been up all night/You will never even know/You're the reason why
Not loyal to land / Nor am I to government / Only ideas

Rainy Morning Haiku
Ships pass in the night / On waters dark and frigid / Wakes never touching
Clocks no longer tick / time has no space when with you / Universe free float
As the clock ticks down / And our bones begin to creak / Regret starts to seep
A failure of health / and of mind, body and soul / lay in death's embrace.
And I give to you / All of the love in my heart / No more and no less
A morning haiku
This field is now gone. Earth ground into concrete flour. Hope blown on the wind.
Hardest thing in life / taking a few steps back and / letting them be wrong
You were nice to me / When I had no faith in me / I want to say thanks
Like a broken tree. / My heart leans in constant fear. / Waiting for a breeze.
I long to hear you. / Your whispers are a sweet song. / Your words, like fine wine.
January sun / pries open red rheumy eyes / and wine soaked regret.
The owl soars silent / It takes a hold of its prey / Victory is sweet
Dark leaves flutter down / Smoke drifts gently from my pipe / A dream-filled morning
I am nobody / I am simply carved of wood / but no one’s puppet
splinter of sunlight / piercing window, screen, and shade / this prism dancing
Yes I still love you/I must be weak or just a fool/it has been a year
Eternal sunlight / Cleansing the darkness within / Open eyes again
Waning until full/ the second eye of heaven/ now lies wide open
The serenity / Summer gives to Autumn time / Leaves fall gently down

15 cents a day / you can feed an African / they eat your pennies
F*cking Nickelback / Please exit my mind now / I’m waking up soon
A deer trotting on/ The quiet hunter watches/ another life gone
The sun hails morning/ shy amid the muted sky/ quiet lavender.
at last am ready / to do what I want to do / but now I'm dying
Wind sweeps me away / to resist is foolishness/ thus I choose to fly
Awoke at midnight / Thunder banging at my door / Zeus is drunk again
Oh what a pleasure / to see trees lining my path / of discovery.
First tea of the day. / Sun shining through the window. / When someone loves you
Always know that / even on rainy days / the sun still shines.
I’m over the moon/ I’ve been to the sun and back/ I’m in love with you
Rain drops pelting down/ Erodes the anthill slowly/ Until all is gone
Blood pumpin’ in veins / Thank You Norepinephrine / Neurotransmitters
I really miss you/ Like sunflowers miss the sun/ On a cold, dark night
Reddit distracts me / number on the clock goes up / unfinished homework
Your love makes me itch / others may touch the same skin / no one else can scratch
安楽, Comfort
Her eyes warm deep pools/I'm fearing I'll drown in them/a death worth dying
I am stuck at work / It makes me sad to be here / dreaming of craft beer
Mirror on the wall / Everything will be alright / So please smile for me
democracy is / rarely practiced in lifeboats / real or imagined

Wrote it on my face / But nobody really looks / Please, just, someone care
"I love you," I yell / From the cliff, to the canyon / "I love you," it yells
My dog hates the mail / woof woof, woof woof woof, woof woof / no love for the mail
Everything changes / The way I feel about life / Changes everything
A Haiku About Net Neutrality
A thief came to me / Who didn’t steal my petty wealth / But my heart instead.
There once was a girl... / Ooops, this ain't Limerick sub / But... err... "Nantucket"!!!
Suicide attempt / I got some of each flavor / Then I changed my mind
Love hasn't favored me./ With her it's all different./ She thinks i'm enough.
So, you're in the mob?/ How's organized crime lately?/ Could you untie me?
zombies pouring in / now down to my last ammo / soon I will join them
Writing a haiku / Then posting it on Reddit / Check that off my list
blasphemies are just / vibrations in our windpipe / skies take no offense
We flattened the world / stood before the jagged edge / closed our eyes and jumped.
Red stain on the floor / I cry out in agony / A wasted pizza
The forecast was wrong./Reluctant sun conquers rain,/Sweeps grey clouds away.
Depressed for so long / My will to live has returned / My fear of death, too
Oh, to be the wind / Who, alone, holds the pleasure / Of tussling your hair
just friends, she and I / she leads, knowing I'll follow / her long skirt billows
I know we don't talk // But I wanted to wish you // A Happy Birthday
A good haiku is / designed to be incomplete / like my favourite
Old age clings to me, Powdered snow that won't shake off, Is it time to go?
all these moonlit nights / have some secrets to tell you / don't fall to slumber
Sometimes I miss you / but you are a cheating whore. / Give my sweater back.
At the Spider Inn/ All flies are welcome to rest/ On the finest beds
Today I wrote a haiku in japanese. I have included the japanese, romanji, and english translations.
I can make you laugh / But because you hate my guts / I can't make you smile
Come to class later / I want to sit next to you / So our knees can brush
No one can stop me/Not even syllable rules/I am unstopa-
Do your ears hang low?/That's a serious problem/Seek medical help
You were my first muse/I thought about you always/For about two days
Teach a man to fish / and he will drink too much beer / and forget to eat.
My breakfast making: not all its cracked up to be: eggshell in omelet.
My balls start to itch / In public, many people / Fight the urge to scratch
It is a sad truth / if my socks had ovaries / I’d be a dad now
Like lemmings off cliffs / humans flock to a leader / who is just as blind

My dog is dying/ I need to dig a grave now/ or the ground will freeze 
Birds chirp happily / world thaws from winter slumber / dour meadow finds color
Tall dark and handsome / And loves long walks on the beach / Lives with mom, swipe left
Edging Cautiously/Virgin jeans undone at last/Sharp intake of breath
Trump and Kim Jong Un / Chillin out with Vladimir / Sexual Tension
Despite the rumors, / Whispered up and down the halls, / I’m really quite nice.
Famous Last Words of a Potato
"Adventures await!" / "So much of life is ahead!" / I am too tired...
It's so nice outside / why's that guy yelling numbers? / golf ball to the head
I want to ask you;/ keep chasing winter with me?/ never end this fun.
Freezing wind howling/ The branches bare and blackened/ Tomorrow flowers
Pink clouds on blue sky / Reflecting the moon's daylight / Night round the corner
Frost on the river / All boats have been pulled in tight / Chicks are home to roost
Hey, I love haikus! Glad there is a sub for this... Can I post stuff here?
I wish to fly high / Yet i'm standing here alone / Looking at the sky
Magician spider / levitates mid-air but the / sun exposed his wire
The road to success / Lies behind a mountain of / Unspoken failures
Cucumber water/is for customers only/at day spa and nail
If you see someone/Who looks like they need a friend/Be that friend to them.
Do not fake yourself / Through acceptance of your faults / You can become free
Green grass colored yellow / Sun waves heat with mellow coat / Paint everything
The anxiety / That I’ll never fall asleep / Keeping me awake

Lazy little bees / Venture out territories / Wilderness ahead
Whisper so softly/*insert what she'd like to hear*/pretend that it's love
Run from emotion/I will flee from my dark thoughts/marathon distance
When she doesnt call / Everything sounds like your phone / Ringing in your head
Tossing cloudy sheets / over the horizon and / tucking in the sun
Been here for ages / The beauty of cold showers / They never run out
These words they choke me/like a vine around my throat/creeping from my heart
Loosely braided stems / a dainty crown for a queen / small yellow stained hands.
Hunched over in pain/ It’s mother nature’s revenge/ My poor uterus
I need some insight / Inspiration for my work / Send suggestions, please
There will come a day / When the last bridge collapses / Yet the river flows.
I was just looking/For something you deemed profound/In the wrong places
Just as easy as/ I fell for you, we quickly/ Then just fell apart
This hole in my chest / needs to be filled with something / maybe money will work
If you're feeling sad / Come into my open arms / I will comfort you
Can a mote of dust / Upon reaching sentience / Influence its course?
unexpected rain / her smile was my umbrella / and then the sky cleared
Different city / Yet the feeling stays the same / Or could it be me?
Your eyes skim right past / one among thousand others / just another poem
Imagine a tree / All alone in the desert / Bearing fruits and hope
I hope age will tell / what want and need truly mean / and how they differ
You made all the sounds/And I painted their colours/I chose the wrong shades
this Moon is ancient / and the darkness that awes you / gnaws at you, is, too
I should be sleeping/Instead I’m surfing Reddit/Tomorrow I’ll pay
On words and coffee;/the bitter is the better/when need to wake up.
I ignored your text / but I saw you at the bar. / I'm in love again.
Flannel, blankets, bed. Rain patters on my window. A blissful fall night.
Two dead sparrows lay / beneath newly melted snow / 'top frozen pebbles

In tears, I kissed my/ newborn baby boy and his/ departed mother
A hard working man/unemployed and useless now/hope is running low
Footprints in the sand, washed away by time's grey tide, were there nonetheless.
Behold, in great depth / how infinite our oceans / yet, so unexplored.
encumbered boughs bend / barren trees slice the gale / I am empty too
I have to chuckle, / I backed into a prison / of my own making.
he walks in, at last / I don't bother to say hi / dead hearts are silent
The bird sings to him / evening sun through prison bars / his one happiness.
our conversations / became one person talking / while everyone shouts
No motivation/if I just apply myself/life could be better
this house is burning / aghast, I stand smoldering; / with no one to save
First bird sings out proud, / cutting through soft cricket sounds./ Calling up the sun!
The world erupted / stars birthed their delicate light / and so, you were born.
Air still warm but dry / A leaf crackles underfoot / Winter is coming
This is my haiku / If you don't like it, screw you / It obeys the rules.
We are all broken / But, that's how the light gets in / Don't hide in the dark
Silence kills us both / Your voice halts this murderer / Save us, please speak up
when I cry at work / the other clowns take notice / and grin nervously
Kangaroos are fat /who are they stompin around/ like they own the place?
i'm not at the top / to be keeping your spot warm / i belong up here
very happy cat / a sleeping weight in my lap / I think she loves me
I can’t feel my face / When I’m with you. Oh god, help / I’m having a stroke
Card arrived today / you said, "happy birthday, son." / but where have you been?
Mother's dementia:/if memories are shadows/best not waste the light.
Here's a life pro tip / The missed opportunities / Shape our lives the most
New job, new toilet
The most painful of / dreams are of conversations / never to be had.
'But it looked like fun' / is not a valid defense / in a court of law.
night ends on a truce / we sleep by dying embers / and trade warmth for dreams
Summer breeze blowing / Tall grass swaying back and forth / Hold on lady bug
Tidal clarity/ The memory of your smile / Pointing at the moon
I woke up naked / Between cereal boxes / The store is busy
lost you in between / sips of tea and puffs of smoke / it's fine, found myself
Single strand of hair / far too long to be mine / all I have left of her
Incomplete person/Even put together well/Still cannot function
Zippers should be black / so if your pants are unzipped / nobody sees it.
You're like inception. / I wake up in a new dream / each and every day.
Winter. More winter. / I blink. Spring, summer, fall; gone. / Winter. More winter.
She left. I can't sleep./My daughter moved to Japan./One out of the nest.
I woke up smiling / and it took just a moment / to remember why.
There is nothing wrong / everything is as it is / even though, it sucks
A people machine / put in experiences / out comes behavior
Blue melts into black, with nuclear balls of fire. I love the night sky.
Her side of the bed / now holds my book, phone, remote. / Think I prefer it
please keep sleeping dear / because i will too tonight / together at last
If you want power / Threaten to break something, like / Hearts or convention.
I had a bad day // Then I helped out a stranger // Now I feel better.
Boldly face the world/ chin up, chest forward, proud grin/ ....my zipper's down.....shit
Be truly fearless/ overtake the broken parts/ that once defined you
Arizona sky / Not a single soul in sight / Gas Station is Closed
With bated breath wait/ Strong winds of the future break/ Is this a fart joke?
Emergency Haiku
Unrequited love / Can I really call it that? / perhaps it's just lust
Blissful misery / Smell of beer and cigarettes / alone with many
A month of Facebook Haikus
I have no money, Is that meth we are cooking? I am rich as fuck
Coughing is painful / Come watch me exhale daggers / I hope I don't die
On A Mountaintop/ I slice Open My Stomach/ Sipping An Egg Yolk
My friend called me wise/I believe I was just tired/cigarettes in rain
drunk we embraced death / summer nights chasing light speed / our souls crashed for us
Here I lie, crying / Alone as per usual / My tears are hidden
I killed my father/ and blindly wed my mother/ I am Oedipus
Shattered river ice / sews itself back together / pale scars crisscross wrists
Distractions dart by/ Like a starved hound I pursue/ As time escapes me
Why, Inspiration?/ I reserved us a table/ but you stood me up.
When the ash settles / And the darkest sun shines dull / You'll have a nice lunch.
Half a life we live, as wandering outsiders, leaves in the forest.
Chicago winter / L train rumbles overhead / Snow falls silently
Her moans of heaven/labored uncontrollably/burn hell to white ash
Anyone self-published Haiku?
Let your heart roam free / Or you'll take it to the grave / And it dies with you
Insurmountable. / Silence, a wall between us. / A ghost in the night.
Though, what do you do? / When the storm came and removed / Everyone you’ve loved?
Crowded train at stop / People trying to get off / Fucktards getting on
Haiku-land seems bland / more slick is r/limerick! / Verdict by mods: banned
your smile sent shock waves / that I forgot I have lungs / and my legs have knees
Worker bees can leave/even drones can fly away/the queen is their slave
Cool air and crisp sheets, Cleansed city all washed clean, Thank you scary storm.
I have the pleasure/ Of seeing you in dreams when/ Distance divides us.
I will taste your love, that instrument of torture, to my dying day.
Heralds of the Christ / are a martyrdom of pines / laid to rest at curbs
I like your mind and / listening to the B-sides / can we be lovers?
the city bankers / watch as the tattered beggar / points at them and laughs
Three in the morning / I awake to him staring / unblinking at me.
垂準 - plummet
Trapped in the drifting / but drove away with flowers / flying off in pink
The nighttime thunder/Frightens animals and birds/My peaceful slumber
The phone makes me deaf/The coffee machine brings life/Hell is lined with desks
Redefine success / Health is found in inner peace / Wealth, in being kind
All I love will die / I will become old and poor / And then I'll be gone
Cool pool, dip my feet / Rivers running down my back / Soaking up summer
Her beautiful eyes/they tell me such a story/change from blue to red
Bathroom Pokemon/ are not allowed at my house/ since they picachu
Starting to call you / "Come watch the butterflies" / But I am alone - Taigi
From the roof i gaze / night cloud melt into the sky / i must let it go
One lonely morning / small spider out my window / gone when the rain comes.
Scrap of white paper/ soft words crumpled and tossed away/ summer rain begins
Accomplished a goal/Jumped down a rabbit hole/What have I done, oh my
Wind is nudging the / Conifer conversation / whispering to Sky
Sometimes a feeling / Never wants to go away, / though you may hate it.
and when our lips met / we both remembered the sea /anchovy kisses
Golden leaves flutter/Down through the fading light, like/Sun-kissed confetti
Did I do this right? / I'm not very creative / Haikus are real hard.
Aripiprazole: / A band-aid on a knife wound. / My thoughts keep bleeding.
Afternoon drizzle / Bird wings flapping in a puddle / Its bath time
Wet season arrives / with hard rain, sharp little slaps / black umbrellas bloom.
Summer betrayal / the cold shoulder of Autumn / with jackets for June
Smoking cigarettes / Addicting and destructive / Like you were to me
Haikus make no sense/ they end in the strangest ways/ velociraptor
The sun is angry / I breathe desiccated earth / The sky hoards water
Hey everybody / The Procrastinators Club / Will not meet Thursday.
How could she have died? / She was so beautiful / Golden, Blushing Bride
The river rises / sending my snowman downstream / to sleep with fishes
Lone tree, old but strong / Lightning struck mercilessly / In flames, still standing
Mud swallows my boots / struggling to stay afloat/ life: in a quagmire.
I have a good boy / I wish he was still with me / I miss my good boy
Try Tinder she said / Lots of guys on there. Funny, / all of them called Dick
Have you tried turning / it on and off again like / I told you to do?
For April Fools' Day / I'll act like I want to live / Because that's Funny
Can’t stop loving you. / The unconditional type / ...unfortunately
Just like a raccoon: / I could be doing better, / But garbage is fine.
her ghost consumes me / laughing, memories on mute / April's reminder
it's snowing, he said / as if we couldn't see it / people really suck
You want me to rhyme?/ Pfft, I ain't got time for that / Haikus are less work
I won't take shelter./ Magnificent thunderstorm./ melt me all away.
The morning's cold rain / A wooden door half open / carrying ill news.
evening equation / feet minus shoes plus carpet / equals elation
Age changes us all / Lusting after memory / Illusions gone by
Silver desert moon / I know a lonely woman / Stars whisper her name
Warmth spreads in my face, / As my chest swells, just a bit. / Someone likes my work.
Her gorgeous smile / shook me like an etch-a-sketch / dissolving my world
Your absence. It hurts. / Thoughts of you, tears, and prayers. / Perhaps at sunrise.
ideology / speaks of the utopia / but "u" turns to "dys"
I'm breaking apart. / Putting myself together / will take a long time.
A dandelion / blooms despite harsh autumn frost, / it must be confused.
Had chemo today / I've only eleven more / Through Valentines's Day
Of all the men's sons/mine will be the happiest:/He'll never be born.
Trees must grow then rot / The past fades and future strays / Now is all we've got
Now that you are gone / Lonliness like a splinter / Gets under my skin
In the dead of night, a head turns and an eye gleams, the owl springs downwards.
Walking through dense fog, / Struggling to find my path. / Damn cloud in my brain.
Hate, such a strong word / Take off the H, and you ate / No e, get a hat
the light of a fire / dusk spreads across the mountains / I watch embers dance
Procrastination/ Psychological dispute/ Never ending tale
In butterfly speak/ there is no word for "ugly"./ Why would they need one?
5/7/5
Summer joy we shared. / Memories fixed within me. / Eternity glimpsed.
A good friend has passed, / faithful, loyal to the last, / his love, now steadfast.
I WANT you around / Your smile fills my heart with warmth / I do not NEED you.
Like a bird she sang / I fell in love with her voice / And listened all day
Your beautiful smile. / The confidence in your eyes. / I love you, mirror.
A brown leaf flutters / gently severed from it's home / to become the earth
Doing drugs at home/wallowing in self pity/better than working.
This post is a boat / On the ocean of reddit / I hope it won't sink
some use 'space slash space' / some use 'no space slash no space' / I use 'space slash space'
Stale sweat on the breeze/ Hobo weathered by the sun/ And we walk on by
Old women secrets / The South is like a whisper / Gasping, "Bless their hearts."
As the seasons pass / Do not be sad they are gone / we used them to grow
the peak of my writing / Was done while wearing a fez / NOW I WRITE IN CAPS
Nature fills my eyes. / Her beauty is all I see. / She blinks, I am gone.
Kitty...please come here / I could use a loving friend / Your purrs make me smile
Rocks are really hard/Or sometimes they can be soft/Depends on the rock
I think that my life's / sole purpose is being a / cautionary tale.
Your lips fooled my own / thinking they would one day meet / but they never could.
Happy holidays / The snow falls like angel shit / for Christmas Haiku.
Reading silently, the candles throw their shadows, late into the night.
The past is long gone./The future is out of reach./Now is all we have.
Won't you open up? / Let me read your face and mood / You're my favorite book.
afternoon thunder / in the land of the big sky / the end of summer
I've fished many years / But, I let the best one go. / It wasn't a fish.
The last cicada/screaming alone in the tree./I hate that fucker.
what amazes me / is all of the time we spend / being unhappy
And again it comes / brought forth by harmless events / the depressing thought
Eight minutes time, and / ninety million lonely miles / becomes my shadow.
Looking at your face, / I clench my stomach and pray / that lunch stays down there
(what are emotions?) / i feel like i'm a robot / slowly breaking down
Why did I not ask / I was nervous and afraid / to ruin nothing
I take my mask off / In the safety of my room / My true, hollow self.
Summarizing my life in Haiku
I have a wife now. / Focus, I can't make a mistake / for I is now we.
Rage when my fist struck./ Shame has remained in me since,/ Precious bedroom wall.
There's a beauty in / The way you fold your clothes / Or I'm just in love
I'm no one special / I'm just an artsy asshole / Writing pretty words
When you have children / you want to live forever / until you lose them
To become yourself/ One must overcome the fear/ of knowing yourself.
Some words on a page / A minor contribution / A lurker no more
Look up in the sky/is it a bird or a plane/no just Superman
Coffin nail in hand / Cancer eating at my lungs / Time for one last smoke
Police custody / Dying of thirst and shaking / Natural Causes
Worker bees can leave/ Even drones can fly away/ The queen is their slave
The screech of a hawk / The sound of a distant train / As something arrives
I just can't go on/thinking about you and I/I unfriended you
I eat and I cry / Masticate and lacrimate / I just don't know why
Time is a fabric/ we wear it secure, until/ our thread unravels
Diamond ring sparkles / Winter winds bend oak branches / Our breath warms the air
The pain that I feel / Reflects all my laziness / And bad decisions
seven Haitian whores / a thousand dollar phone bill / fiance's puzzled
Dark, rich garden soil / worked with hoe and hands and heart / from seed to table
Your words are wounding, / your tongue is a scalpel and / your aim is perfect.
I feel your heart beat. / Sometimes it matches with mine. / Sometimes it doesn't.
We hug. We cuddle / I fall hopelessly in love / Such beauty are we
Help me I am stuck / In a haiku factory / Save me before they-
It's true: I'm angry. / What would you expect from me? / I'm treated like shit.
I live with a girl / Her constant lies betrayed me / She lives alone now
I love you so much/ All that I want to do is/ Get drunk and hold you
I travel the lands / asking rides of kind strangers / I'm a hitch-haiku
/r/movies banned me and made me apologize in haiku in order to lift the ban
The world is a blur / Why am I always busy? / Sleep eludes me still
You cheated on me / Broke my heart a thousand times / But I love you still
Monosyllabic / girl says: Yeah. Nah. Like. Um. 'Kay. / And I still love her
hoping to impress / I make up constellations / Orion's anus
Cheap Mexican food/ My farts are filling the air / Chile Rellenos
It's 3 am
Lost my wife last month... I was going for a Haiku but I can't make it fit.
Haikus and Candy / My Siren Song Calls Children / Playdate Rated X

ukiah sdrawkcab a / daer ot drah yllautca si / ti htrow si ti tub
Talking quietly / Sometimes wiping falling tears / Old men talk of war
Look into my eyes / A fallen king with no throne / I am a tyrant
Voice sweet like honey/ fluttering heart when eyes laid/ you are my one wish
Hands on ears, on knees/waterfall cacophany/please be quiet, still
The first few rain drops / Sizzle on the parched asphalt / Urban petrichor!
Stringing pretty lights / their phosphorescent flash is / Christmas in July
Steaming hot water / Filtered through paper and beans / Pourover coffee
If I Had My Way / Things Would Be Better For Me / Look Out For Yourself
It’s not my circus. It’s not my way to waste time. Eh, not my monkeys
Not my circus. It’s not my way to waste time. Eh, not my monkeys
Not my circus. It’s not my way to waste time. Eh, not my monkies
Nothing’s a mans world / The kingdom is in turmoil / I weep for dragons
Down by the river dont you know
She sleeps in my arms / Suddenly a pungent smell / another boom-boom
A country hook up / No map is reliable / I am surely lost
An eagle flies free / The king for a thousand years / Ride the sky, child
Supporting the arts / patrons forest walk under / color canopies
distance our context / from shadows we silhouette / appear then sunset
Birds chirp happily / world thaws from winter slumber / dour meadow finds color
distance like context | from shadows we silhouette | appear and sunset
The afternoon winds / Pushing the freshly risen sails / Waking up, stretching out
That's just what we did / The difference a line can make / That's just, what we did.
My master calls me / electronic sound commands / My shiny smartphone
i'm in love / there's a rainbow / over my soul
The moon is in view / Illuminating the night / I can't fall asleep
the ink still sings/ on my fingers/ cherry blossom rain
Eyes filled with hatred / As she faces her mirror / Now just shards remain
My last thought will be / (If given the time for one) / So much yet to do
Fingers atrophied / paralyzed hand-writing is / the arthritic thumb
Not another day / More to come; in the same vain / Unchanging outcomes
Haikus about my new OCs
Tolerance abound/All people and things welcome/Except for lactose
Your skin is silken. Your heart is carved from old stone. The fault is all mine.
The harvest moon shines / let's go plant some tomatoes / and find me a wife
Micro is better / “Shhh! Don’t tell other people.” / My Econ prof said
An identity / Built solely to conceal faults/ Aren't you tired?
Tall dark and handsome / And loves long walks on the beach / Lives with mom, swipe left
Don't put pants on me/ My willy should be all free/ All should gaze on me
Really wanna poop/ Coming out of my rectum/ Clenching really hard
When I was in court/The innocent cried and pleaded/The guilty did too.
A dream about you/Evokes emotion no more/Means nothing to me
A dream about you/evokes emotion no more/means nothing to me
We met in the spring, / Fell in love in the summer, / And died in winter.
To sate all wishes / Desires defined completely / Content only then
Spellbound, envious / An unwanted audience / Get your own pizza
Afternoon running haiku
Coughing is painful / Come watch me exhale daggers / I hope I don't die
Let peace be with us/always constant never gone/a little boys dream
The snow is falling/to give life in the new spring/Frozen water gone
I am no poet/I write haiku though sometimes/Pretentious at best
van gogh's frightening/ clarity was the least he/ could say of nature.
Blue Skies are leading / but Grey Clouds are passing and / took hold of the rains
“Je suis taïwanaise.” / write that on my insta bio / to remind myself
The day spent dreaming / My progress remains stagnant / Get to work dumbass
I lost my left sock. But that’s not the funny part. I still wear my shoe
Plastic and ink flows / A tool only, has no life / yet shares inner worlds
You killed them all dead / you just downright blew their minds / encore mi amore
Ding! Your name pops up/not my problem anymore/swiftly deleted
Pasty like raw dough / soft light downey flesh on mine / I love you pillow

Rainy morning haiku
Together at last. / The earth no longer holds my soul / as it once did yours.
Lost soul wandering / A good place to stop tonight / Not there idiot
Edging Cautiously/Virgin jeans undone at last/Sharp intake of breath
A salty winter / forecasting a salty spring / sweating off the snacks
Singed trees, ashen stumps // Cancer across the valley // A great erasure
And just like clockwork/ right when you’re comfy in bed/ you gotta go pee
Call me, your savior / I will breathe life into you / You will swim again
Morning dog walk haiku
The Kaiju appears / Behold! humanity's end / King of the monsters
I love who you are / Parsley, sage, rosemary. Time / You are my best friend
Conform to bias / See me even when you sleep / Time, it seems, is now
our thoughts troubled till / burgers and banana splits / finally carefree
Li’l
I have to go poop/ there is no bathroom nearby/ agony persists
Aardvark (I'm new to haikus pls give feedback)
A beating brass heart / Gears clicking in unison / Thanks, dad. I miss you.
Call me, your savior / I will breathe life into you / You will swim again
The stereos blare / Wailing auditory waste / Poison's terrible
Over-bloated bluffs / bulging with vulgar houses / scarfing up the woods
You cannot help me/I don't want to hurt you, so/Please just go away
Worn, faded and stained / The rag dries the artist's brush / It lives its purpose
Observing the world, / only a tiny being / amongst the giants.
One swipe to the right/A chat, a coffee, a walk/One kiss, told me all.
Pestilence Resort / mosquitoes are returning / on buzzing jet skies
do you have to go/ the door is over there but/ I could help unpack
Motörhead kicks ass / girl love me like a reptile / the hammers comin'
Seagulls are soaring / Unseen currents overhead / Cries of freedom found
the heavens shine down / constellations drawn by man / stories to be told
Hot spicy coffee, enough to start the day right, no cream or sugar
Capitalism / Welcome, a Dog-eat-Dog world / Cannibalism
Snitches get stitches/ If they don't have insurance/ They will bleed out fast.
Love is delicate / Its beauty can fade away / Like cherry blossom

Smoking an old pipe. Enjoying the warm spring breeze. Southern living - please

Ink stains blank paper / Rich illustrations of word / Each page, a mirror
My mom, her last week / asked how it was happening/ I had learned enough
for the second day/ passing by a blooming bud/ how continuous?
I want to die now / put a bullet in my skull / will I regret this?
You were nice to me / When I had no faith in me / I want to say thanks
Perfect Winter Day
It's okay
Why do I do this?/ 13 weeks until exams/ Yet I choose Reddit
I sent a haiku / to a poetry contest / please give me your votes
Their Saturday bath / had left a ring of dirt and / some floating feathers
I've lied to myself/ So I make this pledge to truth/ "Later" begins now
I stand off the cliff / I float in mid-air​ waiting, / waiting to fall down
Given the state of / the state; what we need most is / union. Not a speech.

Some old Haiku's I wrote
Book Cover
The shadow play was / silhouetted censor cat / chasing motion mouse
A man’s wedding ring/A woman’s leopard print dress/Winter pretender
Help me make Haiku for friend BD
Where did the love go? / Once so alive, strong, vibrant. / Today...a new start.
The sweet flowers bloom/ to be frozen in winter/ yet woman lives on
Firmly leashed/ oh unrivaled loyalty/ I am chained to thee
Clear cut comment bait.
We sat to play chess/the winner led the foxtrot/ I laid down the queen
beginning premise modified by this new line; and now it concludes
Life does not matter/I will go into the dirt/Just a matter of time
Through the panes of glass/ The light is out of the eyes/ It shines in the heart.
A crush:
Paranoid human / fundamentals of love lost / it must be rebuild
Work afternoon: Lacking words to use/Would like to have energy/ Challenge to go on
Work afternoon Lacking words to use / Would like to have energy / Challenge to go on
A hydraulic lift / is spattering and hissing / confronting the dog
The gray winter sky/ Now mirrors my state of mind/ Darker each moment
We, too, would see far / if on giants' shoulders stood / but we bear their soles
Simmering sunset/ slowly seasons salty seas./ Sandy shores sing songs.
Just contemplating / the wabi-sabi of a / used Squatty Potty
Welcome to the void / Drift into black nothingness/ Time and space, dissolved
Crowd of witnesses. / Good News received and given. / Friend, come and follow!
Nightly nonsense
The demons are at my door/banging, scratching, wanting more/hungry for my soul
The moon reflects me./ My bright side casts brilliance./ My dark side won’t show.
Blood is on your hands/Want your freedom so you can/Revel in my Death

Wrote this one in high school
Shattered river ice / sews itself back together / pale scars crisscross wrists
For your protection / The identity police / are already here
Poker face laundry / concentrated couple and / the loser will fold
Such things, come and go, /As the waters of the tide; / Coming, going: thus
[NSFW] Just for good measure / Always keep a coat hanger / next to the staircase
I'll take care of you/ When you eat, I'll go hungry/ Who takes care of me?
Once a roaring flame. / Now only heat as coals glow. / What of tomorrow?
no cold air or tunes/the spare is bald as a bat/but hey I like it
(2017-1012): That he was a storm / But not the kind you run from / Its the one you chase
Round circles...
You’re still part of me / But you are not what I need / I acknowledge you
He thanks you again/You still say you’d like to go/I’m too exhausted
These desires haunt me / Raiding the doors of my soul / Be still soul I’m here.
Oh you poor kitty!/Are you being neglected?/Cat rubs leg -meow
Pills, booze, broken glass/hear birds chirping, but alas/they can seize the day
gnats in my kitchen/ flying every where they can/ are they even friends?
Dragged myself to work / Awake but am scatter brained / Path least resistance
Deployed for battle / sabotaging hatred and / trenching flags in peace
Compassionate push / calming frustration in the / Samaritan snow
NSFW Your job is risky / keep gun with you while shitting / overconfidence
snow held in pine trees\ Sun makes them give up their hold\ shimmering on distant hills.
I woke up groggy / Anxious reasons to stay home / I chose to be late.
The rock stands bare-faced / and wonders when it will die / like the life it sees/
Extended haiku: Spring's a nurse of war/ It heals winter's survivors/ and regroups soldiers// Summer's a.....
Boil these dry leaves, / Pour the water in my cup. / You have spilled the tea...
Loneliness each day. / Love and comfort found in faith. / Rough this pilgrimage.
oh so very sore / feeling too hot and too cold / horrible headache
Make children wear green / Give them rifles, call them men / Call it deterrence.
Beer, broth, and spices / Popped the Insta-Pot cherry / For pork roast Sunday

The 10th Commandment / broken by a Cowbird who / coveted a nest
Love is an echo/of our desire to be loved/whispered to the dark
Brief was our visit. / Love expressed. Joy shared. Hearts warmed. / Cherished memories.
melancholy blues / nights of tears on pillow sheets / solemn catharsis
Wipe your tearing eye; / Does your mouth smile wide for me? / O, to laugh with you...
I see your eyes shine / Does your mouth smile wide for me?/ O, to laugh with you.
So then I ask you / what does one do when true love / grows wings of its own
So I’m asking you / what does one end do / when love grows strongwings
Behind me follows / the breeze sings a message / carry me away
No one looked harder / I spot wolf near the village / No one believed me
Lesser fear of sharks /Graceful creatures of the deep /You have my respect.
Autumnal Rains
The Ice King cometh /Dealing death where life once stood / Our saviour Jon Snow
Lightheaded I fell / the Earth rose to welcome me / my first cigarette
What is a raindrop / but a single metaphor / for my fall to earth
The neon district / a lightning bug wink while they / solicit a mate
A starch collar is / strangling the city in a / freezing winter fit
Poker face laundry / concentrating on their cards / the loser will fold
Old Man Winter is / showing shabbiness while the / thread-bare grass pokes through
The lewd attire is / envious of loveliness / wearing modesty
The past will often / try to attack the present / with its memories
Although I am young / it feels, as if my lifetime / has reached its Autumn
A lot can happen / in seven months, but I sure / didn't expect this
This, I know for sure / although my wounds are many / I am still standing
Forest of trees, each / differently imperfect / not unlike ourselves
Tell me when and where / and for you, I will be there / twenty minutes late
Beauty came to me / and climbed to my lap, only / asking to be seen
If you think you can / or, if you think you cannot / you will be correct
Pain to start the day. / Lord, I need strength and healing. / Let's start with a hug.
Fitting new glasses Sexy ones that won’t sit right Your eyes are crooked
Young men lose their minds but old men have forgotten the sirenic call
Life to your body/asleep,unnoticed, always/for granted, poisoned

Misery detached/ Move from point A to point B/ A humble learning
Might Warrior / Faux RPG Adventure / Please Buy My Card game
Old Man Winter is / wearing shabbiness while the / thread-bare grass pokes through
Old Man Winter was / still clutching his coat while the / thread-bare grass poked through
Two months on the hunt / No results soon I could starve/ God please hire me
Computer turned off./ I now prioritise sleep;/ Well rested at last
Three things in this life / cannot be hidden for long / the sun, moon and truth
Blinded by the white. / Numbed to the bone by such cold. / Comfort in your love.
It has been some time/Rainclouds were discipating/The storm gets closer.
Wings beat over sea / carrying a crop of seeds / somewhere new to grow
Romantic ideas / Minimal words telling all / Lost in translation
So when I awoke / I cleared my eyes, then my mind / awake, I saw you
Haikus don’t tell us / poetry read isn’t heart / thoughts that lie between
A lifetime gone by, / finally I can cast Wish. / But what do I want?
Ticking anxiety
Love should be easy / Like a river’s confluence / Rise, retreat and flow
我意愿你/想吃你的豆腐/现在你来
See the golden sky/Ethereal, misty morn/ Apple of my eye
Dog barks at the owl/ the owl calls for a lover/ Some sounds of midnight
reaching for the stars //No backing down of yourself//fighting for control
Website parasite / the Net cast over annoy / harpooning the trolls
Lurid attire is / envious of loveliness / wearing modesty
Old woman clears weeds/ Rekindling memories*/ Of distant childhood
I can catch most things:/ Basketballs, colds and feelings/ But not any sleep.
He, a night person/She preferred the mornings though/They only had noon
Hazy afternoon / The soft sounds of summertime / Children laughing near
Mission was hindered. / Grace energized and guided. / Success then! Thanks now!
Moments full of joy/The rising sun sets the pace//time slows in this place
Each flutter syncopated, put me in the butterfly room, all things that fly know
Dank memes haiku
Winter lays the land / Moonlight dusting the crisp snow / White against the dark
I survived Deadpool/ "You're not Daredevil! Sorry!"/ Amused, he spared me
The snow has fallen/my broken mind grows colder/the depth of winter.
You lived your life caged/ To end up upon my plate/ Now you're free at last
Snow ribbons dancing / across frigid parking lot / beauty of winter
Solitary thoughts/ Thinking of good times we had/ Face to the Fall wind
Alive, still breathing / Exhaling clouds of hot breath / Cold winter’s stray cat
Frost bitten fingers / Footsteps mark the trail behind / Journey’s end draws near
Fat words fall like rain, tumbling from a cloudy night, darkening the page.
Be patient with me, / I've got it all together / but you keep adding.
Please be patient with me, / I've got it all together / but you keep adding.
Miracles we shared. / Experienced together. / Our journey in love!
First haiku. Opinions?
Trying to be cool / Hoping karma increases / Down voted again

I am in a daze/ The streets and people have changed/ Why must this be so
Shattered river ice / sews itself back together / scars replace her breasts
Missing the cuddly dog: Roger
Twenty years ago/ Internet was really slow/ Not that I would know
Laundry was sent out / and driven to the lake in / sheets of muddy ice
passing out drunk here / reinvigorate my cock / show me your buttocks
The castling was caught / by prowess of knight-errant / checkmating the king
Words left unspoken / Feelings that we used to share / Fading memories
a long vacation / most left unpaid and hungry / yet, no border wall
Used to know you like/ the back of my hand. Now you're/ just a phantom limb
Soft haired blossomed kits / Sunrise fur and moonlight eyes / weaning cry for mom
The stars spill across the dome of night deepening the greeny blackness
Half asleep I wake/ The morning makes me regret/ a night of YouTube
We fought against it/ The coming war to end war/ With bullets and guns
Your story touched us. / Hearts and minds were ever changed. / Thank you for that gift.

frozen winter treat / made together with grandma / some vanilla snow
dead fish watches me / people leaving grocery store / spring already had breakfast
dead fish look/ grocery store closing/ rain falls abruptly
Distractions dart by/ Like a starved hound I pursue/ As time escapes me
Cut off from the pod / a porpoise was leaping and / looked for other kites
Joy and thanksgiving. / Love received, given to all. / A glimpse of heaven!
Four blue birds fly east/ Leaving the fifth at the nest/ Spring can't come sooner
Laid awake 8 hours. / Blurred eye, crooked thought, pale skin. / Far, but no closer.
Aimless wanderer / A soul without home or kin / An unwanted stray
Aimless wanderer / I am without home or kin / An unwanted stray
Putting down a straw / and slurping a beverage / in a waterspout
Liquid shits, burning / House of Waffles, cruel mistress / Why do you hurt me
Good news! I have heard. / Good news! Ignites my belief. / Good news! Hosanna!
blinded by the smog / can't stop me from seeing straight / breathe in, and breathe out
Ah, the deadly blues/They enter my life as you/Exit it for him
Why, Inspiration?/ I reserved us a table/ but you stood me up.
Scroll, scroll, scroll, refresh/in the dark, a dying light/three, two, one percent, good night

You keep so hidden/though your beauty does not compare/purple petals please
That first cold shower / Stealing all one’s breath away / Soul returns reborn
Counterfeit couple / a married nightmare faithful / to love of money
That hen-pecked husband / squawking Fowl! from her sharp beak / scratches for new chicks
That hen-pecked husband / squawking fowl from her sharp beak / scratches for new chicks

Being Given Gold, / Who Do I Give Silver To? / So Many Questions...
Your love gives me life. / Joy in serving you, my friends. / Let us dance and sing.
Haiku: home.
Here Aluminum / Just over the pond, England / Aluminum
Under full moonlight The magpies carrolling out They cannot hold back
Forgetting to eat/ Now I am forgoing sleep/ Passion found at last
Her eyes are wet coins. / Too many, they're drowning me. / I hope she leaves soon.
I've found the reason / a warm crippling sensation / why cant i keep you?
It's storming outside, / but it's within that I freeze. / No wood to burn here.
Failing to give thanks. / How can you love me so much? / Ever blessed am I!
A poor beggar pleads / Passers-by can't grasp his pain / Life, here in the City
Lightning spans the night/ Each a shard of light but in/ Tandem, a phoenix
Gazing at the sky, / stuck dreaming of tomorrow, / motionless today.
Is he made of house? / Or is the house made of flesh? / Not knowing, he screams.
When the ash settles / And the darkest sun shines dull / You'll have a nice lunch.
at the firehouse / bukkake for my buttocks / just two frosty globes
"Sahara" Haiku
You left me a gift/ Then gave him a larger box/ I unwrap envy
Imagine a world/Where I'm you and you are me/Changed perspective
Lonely autumn tree,// Your leaves found paradise on// The ground; why can't you?
I don't like reddit/It has weird weird people there/ who like bread on trees
Specificity / 5 7 5 is the one / rule for a good haik...

Eyes with timeless love. / Connected our souls this day. / Treasured memory.
Death in the desert/The most beautiful boy falls/Vultures love him so
Death in the desert/The most beautiful boy falls/vultures love him so
The Last Man on Earth
Mirror in the wall/ I pass by, no reflection / All the lights go off
Slowly do I change / Thanks, Lord, for your patience / Perfected by grace
Tell me how it feels/ To have someone fight for you/ Will I ever know?
This morning I heard/ Your song, your voice, in my head/ A broken record
a life so lonely / a vaguely polite gesture / brings tears to your eyes
Non-traditional
I will not be told / whom to love or whom to hate / I will wed a Child
I will not be told / whom to love or whom to hate. / I'll marry a man.
Golden fall the leaves / "May the Sun shine on your path / And farewell", she said
Tonight, no TV / Perhaps, I'll be a poet / It could set me free
We are naught but ghosts / Riding these horse-like bodies / Through life and through death
You were a mistake / Before I even made you / I can't fix you now
Vaping on the bus / No one looking, inhale / Happy journey now.
Sweet dreams beckon me/ But racing thoughts keep me chained/ So I can't follow
Half a life we live, as wandering outsiders, leaves in the forest.
Your will be done, Lord. / Faith, hope placed only in you. / I choose you always.
Smoke curls in the flue / Gold lights flicker on the hearth / As the window yawns
heritage;
I Thought the Toilet Seat was Down
Faceless laughs online /I hope her gaze in the flesh / Does not break the spell
Comtemplate this bull / Its black fur, with ink and words / You and i have forged
A beautiful soul / Comes from the most damaged heart / By Newton's third law
A beautiful soul / Comes from the most damaged heart / For Newton's third law
More than flesh and bone / An entity of passion / Yet, all too human
The joy of young love / Heavy petting, deep breathing / The birth of new life
Frozen, white spider/ Inside of my drinking jar./ Moonstone eyes pierce me.
Wishing life away / Now, near the end of my life / Let me start again
I came to you soaked/ I was expecting nothing/ You were my towel
4AM
Black eyes under bed / Never thought I’d go this way/ Oh, it’s just Mittens.
White tile stained red / My lover has died and gone / I hold her last gift
Parenthood is like / Reliving pasts, knowing all, / But you don't listen.
Born poor. Died middle class. Success.
Shoulders were your throne/ Now you raise a son your own/ While carrying me.
Monday Afternoon
Humility sought. / Caught with the grace of our God. / Oh how he loves me!
The lunar beauty / On earth and in the heavens / Your light shines brighter
Been finding new music/ That I know you’d really dig /If we were still friends
I count syllables / And recount when they are wrong / I hope you do the same
Shattered, solemn heart//setting, sinking like the sun//hands broken on the clock
Shattered, solemn heart//setting, sinking like the sun//hands broken on the clock
Isolated
NSFW - Two stones one dead bird / make sure that fucker is dead/ wasteful? I think not.
Silver moonlight falls/Through the heat of summer night/Landing on bare skin
If heaven exists / I hope I have done enough / To thank my mother
Drowning in Dharma/ A raft making itself known/ Why bother grasping?
Love...always seeking / Love...giving it to others / Love...returned to me
A perfect stranger / What makes you unique - Google / Look in the mirror
Fix
To be called human/ The savagery and comfort/ The lesson of life
Destined to descend / Leaving a path of silver / Usher of winter
Who are you, really? / Hiding behind a smile / It's a facade
Chicago winter / L train rumbles overhead / Snow falls silently
Ghost I haven’t seen / Unvisited of senses / Like Olive Garden
Salty breeze skims waves/ The Auburn orb slowly melts/ Sea and sand hold hands
Pushing causes pain / siezing in my narrow bones / I think i'll lay down
Hard to stay focused. / Endless, worthless diversion. / Silent moments, please!
I'm ready to rock / But your big hands... husky voice... / My Thai vacation
Gay anal, Father? / "This ain't your first rodeo." / Ooooohh-gaaaaah! Praise the Lord!
Normal is a vex/both nothing and everything/harmonic chaos
Drifting morning fog / rivulets gather and wash / over broken trees.
Today I went out / Out in my car to the bank / Breathing easier
yes daddy i cry / drool slips from my pouting lips / i feel so little
Let me be your wine / But if you don't drink water / You cannot have it
A pair of birds fly/ their reflection on my screen/ mind out of focus/
Why is there no spark?/ When I have all the matches/ They must be burnt out
Oof.
Text wall on mobile
Love is hard as hell/ love is an anomaly/ love is wonderful
A bird chirps, cat meows/ Frog croaks on an autumn morn/ She laughs while I cry.
What is life about?
What is a poem? Is it angst, joy, or simply love? Guess we'll never know.
It was just a kiss/ but I've planned out our wedding/ and how you'll leave me
My 3yr old girl's first haiku: The Space atomic / Ions crossing boundaries / Past neutral atoms
Cold. Dark. Winter blues. / Hope in every ray of sun. / Love...the ray today
I’m the kind of girl/ Who never gets sent flowers/ I’m nothing special
787 / To some a racing legend / To others a jet
The bloated green leaf / Shudders in the utmost fear / Of cold northern winds.
The bright moon looks down / Sparkling ice reflecting back / A million dreams
I worked hard on this. Tell me what you think.
ripple propagates/ across flowing water--SOUND/ the calm from the storm/
Reliving my past / Hello from purgatory / How do I let go
Ripple propogates/ across flowing water--SOUND/ the calm from the storm/
Melted chocolate / Sound of the television / Home is for healing
Water turns to ice / Change is afoot as always / Time won't wait for you
Meaningless time wasted / Sharing our bodies / Not our souls
I am you / you are everyone / everywhere
Thick leafs block sunlight/ Still the rays permeate through/ warming our picnic.
Tell me you love me - gently whisper in the night - and do not leave me.
Hard to love you, friend. / Praying for the help I need / to remove this fence.
We met in passing, Two lost souls seeking comfort, Neither succeeding
Delicious, golden / the quantity of apples / the shallow waters
Reddit together / for interests in common / here’s community
the tone of the wind/ shaping the voice of the rain/how luxurious?
With mom's credit card | I helped John Wick obtain this| Victory royale.
the sound of windchimes/ ears hanging out the window/ a pine scented breeze
Whisper of roses/ The winds carried it to her/ Hands hide her red checks
Good news for us all. / Meditate. Believe. Respond. / Joy amidst the pain.
Frost on the river / All boats have been pulled in tight / Chicks are home to roost
It’s a new garden / Prickly pears jalapeños / but dig what you must
You want what now? / blossoms droop in your presence? / Here is your haiku
You can’t possibly / you will extinguish your own / but, can’t kill the world
maybe if I write/ a poem about the spring/ it will come sooner/
My 7yr old girl's first haiku: I love my mummy / Way more than the universe / And my daddy too.
It is our secret/Why the bullet will shatter/Brain, memories, faith
My cat squats in box / stench rises slowly skyward / Quickly! Down the stairs!!!
I Sit Here All Day/Just Trying to Look Busy/Purgatory Sucks
Warm star wakes early/ Gentle breeze tickles the grass/ Birds chirp reverie.
Heaven reaching walls / contain the chaos outside. / The eye of the storm
most romantic dreams// woken by the sound of rain// stuck in-between states//
Gone is carelessness. / The days of worry now here. / What now? Why? The Fuck?
Each day I climb. / Climb out that bunker of mine. / Only to fall deeper.
Child, did you receive? / Gifts freely given to you. / Joy awaits...unwrap!
Rushing frantically, Slow down! Life’s going too fast. I want to get off.
Deep rumbling wakes me/ when trains boom across the bridge/ while passengers sleep.
A rainy morning/ The sound of a bird crowing/ I could hear the cold
I had a dream once / Joy, sorrow, triumph and loss / Turns out it was life
Haiku for diarrhea
Cynthia you're dead / Cyn-thi-a mmmm Cyn-thi-a / Beep boop bop you're dead
a spark on Snapchat / will it exist in person / I hope we find out
Crowd of witnesses. / So we are...servants also. / Filled with hope and joy.
Delicate Butterfly/Unbridled serenity/Passing slowly by.
A long haiku about size
Leaves of the Sapling 365 Days of Haiku by John Clark Helzer
Empty words spoken / to describe the same feeling / of love - we once shared
Ahead! Acceptance / As anglers troll rippled lines / Shown hands fall or rise
Exposed emotions / in a superposition / just won't collide
Exposed emotions / in a superposition / Just won't collide
A wet runway ride / Slick rubber tires slide slide slide / Metal and rubber
Auburn coloured clouds/ do their best to hide the sun/ yet it waves goodbye
I am but a ghost/No shadow lays beneath me/Only memories
Looking for real love/fairy tale as a kid love/Al and Jasmin love
Watch you set this fire/To destroy the evidence/That you once loved me
No waluigi/We wanted Waluigi/Damn it Nintendo
Smash ultimate
Do you believe that/Our short but sweet love story/Contains the word “again”?
Maybe I'm a ghost /I hope we can spend more time/Does it hurt so fine?
Here in my hands lies A book blank, of infinite Possibilities
Painted sky, your ink/ smears the canvas below, now/ flourishing colour.
I cant write haikus/ they are very difficult/oh wait i just did
Each moment a gift. / Never exactly again. / Tears of remembrance.
You turned grey with age/ You tears fell and soaked the earth/ There, a sapling grows.
I found this sweet band / They sound kind of like Neil Young / But I can’t tell you
Like a broken tree. / My heart leans in constant fear. / Waiting for a breeze.
"When we're apart, // when words won't be enough, // what do I do then?"
this drunken evening / I used you as a toilet / just a little joke
Both are wrapped for cold / kids provided robes for their / angel in the snow
Roots that spine the curb/ Sidewalks turn back to nature/ Dehumanizing
She screamed out "OH GOD"/I know she's an atheist/she must not hate this
She screamed out "OH GOD"/I know she an atheist/she must not hate this
Sound of space
Sacraments...your gift. / Opened they have all I need. / Your love, so perfect.
An old well. Mossy./A Falling leaf breaks fine threads./Cracks its wooden face.
Anyone out there??
Sudden
a weed edible / it's not working i need more / call an ambulance
Prison of hatred/ I grasp the bars, pride grasps back/ Forgiveness freed me.
bad leads to okay \ okay leads to good then great \ this is a haiku
Purification / by fire, repentance for sin - / the whiskey bottle
the bus takes me there / by "there" I mean wherever / too bad I missed it
"I'm With It"
Hey, I love haikus! Glad there is a sub for this... Can I post stuff here?
How I searched for you! / Ah, there you are...connection. / Bonded by our love.
Played spin the bottle / with one thumb on the throttle/ no foot on the brake
a southern winter / the freezing cow awaits spring / just to be slaughtered
Played spin the bottle / with one thumb on the throttle/ no foot on the brake You played kick the can / with sacked cement in hand / nothing left to stake
Selfie in the dark / we’ve been talking for three days / I will marry her
Even all the things/that I wish I could forget/have made my life mine
Nothing seems to last/ Evening star, you come so fast/ Roads wear a white mask
things scare me no more | the dark, moon, the void, and stars | all the same to me
Click to read
Your presence, my joy. / God's plan for you and I...love. / So blessed are we all.
Masturbation time/I think of terrible things/Making my cock hurt
The phone
Her moans of heaven/labored uncontrollably/burn hell to white ash
One on one time, wow! / Each moment, so close, perfect. / Once again Lord. Thanks.
Titled
I read these descriptions of haiku, senryu and tanka... see link
I long to hear you. / Your whispers are a sweet song. / Your words, like fine wine.
Loud & Proud
Golden moon bathes trees : leafs crinkle in a warm breeze : crickets purr silver

A Haiku I Made A Month Ago
Have a book to read // Thousand emotions arise // All in a page bind
Pale winter sunset / drowning under soggy clouds / fever soaks the bed.
Bad news from every side/depression lurks in the dark /a silent battle
Prologue
The red thread of fate // Spun by destiny's hands // A bond between two
Adulthood engaged. / Childhood receded quickly. / Such was a tough time.
I lie still and cold / Frozen; only grief awaits / Solely your warmth heals
Your pants don’t fit you / like your ego they’re too big/ you’ll grow into both
Fairy wings flutter / tickle her ears as she walks / down their secret path
Secret messages / Sweet nothings while you slumber / I delete them all
A sole rubber ball // Bouncing through the bright meadow // A boing, a smile
I keep swiping left/ because you're right next to me/ I only want you.
Unbeknownst to me // And you too, evidently, // We'd always been lost
An interesting title is not permitted
Always do you knock... / When I answer you change me. / Please, come and stay!
`
Tidal
My first childhood friend // A day, thousand adventures // I will remember
Look out as the trees bristle on the valley walls a breeze shivers through
Mellifluous flow / Movement expresses passion / Others envious
Dream about a thought // An escape from the moment // Where I cannot be
Pride got in the way! / Service to you was weakened. / Often do I fail.
Confidence begins / The person in the mirror / Respecting yourself
"Left or right click now?" / "Left click unless specified." / "Left or right click now?"
Midnight summer breeze / Cup of tea , so serene/ A simple life , i smile
I want you to know // I miss our time together // Those fleeting moments
Scattered by the wind/ The heat of summer long gone/ Only you remain
Scattered by the wind/ The heat of summer long gone/ You're all that remains
I sat beside you. / Sharing thoughts. Love exchanged. Joy. / Pilgrims hand in hand.
Feet are sore from work. / A simple thought brings relief. / Friday... finally.
haiku
whipping winter wind / window down, going ninety / anxiousness frozen
We know so many / Different faces of friends / Yet we know little
A six word story/ seven middle syllables/ crap, wrong subreddit
A new door opens here // Stuck in indecision - AHHH!! // Choice leads to brightness
You’ll meet some people, That change the way you see things, Then leave you to it
January sun / pries open red rheumy eyes / and wine soaked regret.
Once more, it happens. / Just give me your new address / And I’ll send flowers
Mixing a drink with / holy water, unabsolved / the sins that follow
A laugh made of wax / and a house made of butter / melted, that summer
Anger leading you. / Prayer given up for you. / On my knees this day.
listen, I hear / I’m not here to rescue you / I give only once
I love her so much / even though things just ended / I still have regrets
Stay, my golden sun // warmth, joy, drive, vision, life itself // go, the world needs you
In the dead of winter / Sleepwalk on my balcony / Cold feet in my bed
Ass red like baboon/swamp ass apocalypse now/gimme that goldbond
Passing Through
True trepidation. / Fear, like a tsunami, sweeps. / What if this goes well?
haiku killer strikes/ five, seven, and then five wounds/ in three body parts
Scurry lurking bird / this sugar is not your life / do not be tempted
Crashing the coastline / scavenging sand castles and / swiping them away
The New Year's party | You didn't make it out to | Does not steer your year.
The New Year's Party | You did not go to this year | Does not define you.
As far as issues// and insecurities go // I've got you covered
The chess pieces move // I don't know how to play this // Keep trying to win
poured my heart onto a page / an ocean of thought / two droplets deep, it drowned.
Each day I wake up / Lonely, trying to forget / The things I regret
before your wedding / you said I was your best friend / now I am a ghost
Day of reckoning // All are held responsible // Judgement cometh!
Words for you this day? / Let us speak of our love, friend. / That is all we need.
I'm not paranoid/ There's just a conspiracy/ To make you think that
It’s my dad, long lost. / Beloved father of mine / who art in heaven.
Death metal haiku/ You will all die in blood flame/ bass guitar solo
wandering rover
Anger can consume / White hot lava, soon to cool / Sadness just lingers
I hope people care // but the feel they feel no sympathy // nor is it deserved
Anger can consume. / White hot lava, soon to cool. / Sadness just lingers.

The buddings you’ve picked / Withered and died in your vase / While outside they bloom
Anyone self-published Haiku?
The buddings you’ve picked / Withered and died in your vase / While outside they bloom
With glasses of love / See without distortion now / Such truth sets me free

The devil is real / He lives in the narcissist/ Run towards the light
Round and round you go / Pressed into the grooves, you sing / nourishing my soul
Your freedom is yours / Keep your lines, keep your lies / From now on, goodbye.
A moment, urging, / Hold... sweat, strain; drive. Drops...dropping. / A life emerging.
Gentle rain. Warm breeze. / Memories, hopes, dreams. Peaceful. / Simple pleasures--joy!
All alone, pitch black/In my bed the thoughts evolve/Fiending for resolve
Tiny winged wonder, Perched on my knuckle to rest. We hold each other.
The lack of sleep peels/layers of your mind away/raw subconscious thoughts.
Dancing in the wind/Thin and fragile in the end/Go begin again
It's been some time ...friend. / Should I call you that? let me / introduce myself
Spuds are vaporized, / Oblivious to their blight. / Refresh... refresh... re...

Two Oh One Eight fades / Looking back I see our steps / One Nine here we come

Even when you‘re near / I miss you because I know / you won’t want to stay

Your love? For me? Now? / Thanks! Teach me to accept it, / and freely share it.
Roses are quite red/ violets are quite violet too/ I really hate you

Last two tomatoes / Hanging under winter frost / Their red hue is gone

More people hate me / Than like your cheap lying ass / I can’t win for not

Set me free tonight / for a moment I'll forget / this reality
that he’s a horcrux / dawned on Harry finally / what an idiot
that he’s horcrux / dawned on Harry, finally / what an idiot
that he is a horcrux / finally dawned on Harry / fucking idiot
Dropped calls Quick Goodbyes/needing to believe your lies/Loving at a cost
Spirits of my past/Ink'd across my page of life/A tattoo of guilt
31 haiku written in the month of first snow at the zen monastery
in the month of first snow at the zen monastery: 31 haiku
wind whips my body/Flagellation straight from God/Repentance needed
did I write this or am I subconsciously plagiarizing?
Quick, commit yourself / Conquer the crocodile / Closest your canoe
He’s so beautiful/What’s this strange relationship/I must let him go
Hastly lifting feet / pavement baked by day, breathing / the taste of sunblock
the buzz wearing off / his doll deflating slowly / “sir, please”, it hisses
feeling nostalgic / for a time that never was / and never will be
Oh Anxiety / if I fall in love with you / will you go away?
Imagined roadblock. / Addressed. Quickly cleared. Sunshine! / Take my hand. Let's walk!
warming up by the fire/until my heart/unclenches
i am not perfect/but no one in this world is/in that, I find peace
i am not concerned / about your room being neat / i’d lay in clothes piles
I get an upvote/on every post/before it is viewed
four hours gone by / laughter in the waiting room / twice now, an uncle
One Two Three Four Five / One Two Three Four Five Six Sev'n / One Two Three Four Five
How to write a haiku haiku
Ode to Sartre haiku
A cloudy meltdown / with a watermark moon in / a puddling of stars
“Hey how you feeling?” / Small, a diamonds pressure / “Great! how’s your mother?”
A Being in the Now (three stanzas)
Mantra I
Discourse, I missed you. / Ideas freely shared. Thank you! / Back into silence.
Nibbas iffy, uh | blicky got the stiffy, uh | Got the blicky, uh
two weeks to winter / next spring's deepest dark secrets / already buried
.
I held the beauty / of the world in my hand, but / shucked it for its pearl
Moving coffee grounds / on the kitchen counter are / instant roasted ants
Love lived out each day. / Sometimes stumbling, often joy. / My pilgrim journey!
Leaves crunch underfoot / Seems like I’ve lost direction / “Make it home.” I sigh
Lost in translation

Just Make Her Happy (four stanzas)
Oh Beautiful Rain
Season of autumn
Where has the time gone?/That is not my reflection/ Pieces on the floor.
Love in your eyes, friend. / There we touched, embraced, and loved. / Closed now...remembrance!
Ugh, I'm so tired/Just enough strength for Reddit/Au revoir bedtime
Apologies r/haiku, from a talentless writer.
Battle intellect/not getting personal yet/how mad can you get?
Battle intellect/I didn't offend you yet/how mad can you get?
A slam haiku because I can't write haikus (nsfw)
Snow falls from heav'n-/Covering the earth below/Heralding winter
Berries and nuts / hang from December branches / set by squirrels
My writing annoys/can't be open minded, free/"FOLLOW MY RULES YOU"
and i dreamt i died / but with time to drive around / and say my goodbyes
"On the Definition of a Haiku" by u/PumpedFail
Uh oh, trouble now/haiku police will show how/writing should be, wow.
Down with the Mod King / They are not doing their job / What is all this tripe
You hear the call, friend. / Will you answer, surrender? / Do it! Love awaits.
My mother’s father/ was a mountain of a man / I’m still looking up
I can’t stay madly / When I need him so badly / I can go, gladly
that lecture bored me / classist, uptight, obvious / as stiff as Ayn Rand
that lecture bored me / classist, uptight, obvious / unclench your asshole
ecstacy at work / makes it hard to concentrate / but my desk feels cool
"I will be LIKE The Most High."
So...why isn't this sub just called "r/poetry" at this point? Since the supposed rules and structure of Haiku are apparently non-existent, what's the point in separating it from just "poetry."
Give life to haiku / Answer what, when, where / Joy and Excitement
Smudges of charcoal / and a smearing of gray for / November's easel
This one is titled "Wrong sub"
Bees buzz endlessly/In the flowers. Can they know/The beauty they make ?
Existential Birthday Haiku
Ancient Green Wilderness/Serenity Atop the Waterfall/Home at last.
Existential Birthday
Dog on leash says woof/ every minute is seven/ scratch his butt for Love
My 1st haiku. Feedback please.
You did not forget. / Life lessons of love learned well. / Given to me! Thanks.
Sitting beneath shade, / seeking calm tranquility / - but rustling leaves roar.
Stuck in the meantime/he's getting drunk on the moon/with supine regrets
While rapturous snow / flurries over antique leaves / peace sleeps underneath
A plink, then ripple/ mirror-lake waves its tendrils/ lazily outward
Heebity hobble/ scoopity floopity pop/ pop goes the weasel
Burning unread words / Flame consumes your memory / Fiercer than our late love
Can't call me asshole/like you think I'll give a shit/I'll scoff and chuckle
She is beautiful / I think that I am in love / she is amazing
five dollars a month / after the thirty day trial / will auto renew
I can't sleep with you / staring down at me, smiling. / Nightmare lullaby.
splinter of sunlight / piercing window, screen, and shade / this prism dancing
Wow, how high this wall! / Quickly you brought it down, Lord. / Thank you for your grace.
First try, help me get better
With a poor man's clothes / Or the richest in the world / I remain myself
Raging waterfall / Tumbles downwards angrily / Roaring in my ears
Are we...no longer a Haiku subreddit? Is this just a random poetry thing now? What happened to the whole point of Haiku being limited to nature and 5-7-5?
Growth for the sake of / growth is ideology / of the cancer cell
Cancer
Hate online dating / Endless swiping and typing / Cannot make it work
The heart of the home / for contemplating flat screens / and mantle remotes
Rolling up to flames / and sticking out a neck it / was spouting for life
A wintry breeze blows / Barren maples slowly sway / Chocolate eyes warm
Moonstruck eyes / watch him rise / honeysuckle spills over.
Spirit -- You filled, led me / Joy -- burns brightly, warms my soul / Hope -- along your path
No bees this summer./Amidst a blossom carpet/not a single one

Moonstruck eyes / watch him leave / rose trellis trembles.
E coli they say / May come from leaves of romaine / But not from Jim Beam
Red yellow and orange/ Smell of leaves and fire wood/ Fall is my favorite
Man is an island / They say. But here I am floating / A woman. Solo.

Another cake day/ read many good posts this year/ nose exhalation.
A Beginning, An Ending
now orange embraced/forgotten are scenes of green/sweetly sour, serene
I complain to you/The chocolate is missing/It’s me, I ate it.
Sign -- "Rough Road Ahead" / Love -- all I need to proceed. / Trust -- with every step.
A life is ended, long, lustrous, loving, laughing, a life beginning
Her glass grip loosens / Clear grain ripples slowly space / Now still, sets her free
obtuse angles/relative to the sun /merely here for now
Third day of snow/ landlord says "Just one more week!"/ daddy pays the bills.
Insecurities/The choppiest of waves crash/Return to stillness
My hand on your throat/ My lips brush against your ear/ “You belong to me.”
This is not a poem/ this is not a piece of art/ I am all alone.
After the horse-play / Narcan flared his nostrils and / stalled out the OD

Hands clasp together/Bitter cold bites to the bone/Yet, like fire, I burn.
Cute little kitty / with a belly full of worms - / ragtag plague-bag boy

Prayers heard, answered. / Now I must give thanks and act. / God, you are awesome!
On these knees I fell/ Oh these tears that i have shed/ Help me to forget
Far away from home. Fighting my battles alone. The coldest winter.
Etched on my glasses / And iPhone screen: the story / Of a thousand falls
Lust
Somehow you knocked down / A well-barricaded heart / And killed everything
even while i am / gazing at the horizon / i still think of her
Motes drift unseen / sunlight seeps through/ boarded up windows.
Barreled apples and / a squashing of cornstalks in / Thanks for the Giving

Zen
Together we prayed. / Take the hand of your angel. / Love poured out for you.
Minimalism
Slip on mossy rocks / wet pants, bucket of crawdads / two friends out till dusk
The joy is shallow / When promise is a mirage / That has fooled us all.
If you see someone/Who looks like they need a friend/Be that friend to them.
Let this rain cleanse me/ Put out the fire within/ A new day will dawn.
ditches lined with spun-out cars, abandoned first snow is magic
I don’t like haikus

A Leaf Floating Down / The Winds Lonely Howl And Cries/ Scatter What Is Left
lurking in the dark/ Deadpool says something snarky/ then he opens fire
They hear the wind blow, and hear the ocean waves crash, but I can’t hear it, I see all these things, But I can’t hear them happen, Because I am deaf,
The senses.
Why not end it all/They shouldn’t care anyway/I wish they did
Three weeks or a year/Finite time matters little/Chase eternity
Flying in to feast / their cornucopia is / birdseed and raisins
The sea waves bursting / Ebb, a figure made of foam / Is made of nothing.

I’ll go back to her, die inside a hundred times, you’ll go back to him.
Challenged you went forth. / You reasoned the answer, wow! / Let us now thank God.
The shadows they creep/ Many whispers gnaw the soul / A light will find me...
I always wonder, When the colors we know die, Blackness fades to what
Morning sun has left / Promises from yesterday / I opened my eyes
The space is so big / Boundless possibilities, / Makes me feel so small
I'm tryna put my dick inside another dick
Gaze in the mirror/ It looks like it's been shattered/ but the glass is smooth
Trees, freezing, lose leaves / But in springtime, they renew / Maybe I can too.
I’m the only one / who totally thought childbirth / was a pain in the...
I have lived this life / questioning my existence, / hope someone listened.
Today I lost you / But more like a year ago / I had lost myself
Worker bees can leave/even drones can fly away/the queen is their slave
No nut November:
Chugg-a-nugg-chugg-SPLAT / “Try turning the key once more” / Sisyphean task.
At dawn, my last song/ While sun danced on my skin/ As breath flies away
Left, Right, Left, Right, Left / What is the correct approach? / There's no point in love
Poor lonely bluebird / a full life of skipping trees, / full of leaves and stays.
Suddenly awake, / the metronome clock ticking, / dream or memory
Just floating with air/ strike me and play with my strings/ or too stiff i burst
Accept and learn. / Faith, hope, trust, leads to such joy. / Will you join me now?
Our Destination/The Skyline of This City/Shining Horizon
Crimson red above /Bitter sting to your nostrils /All hope is restored
Captivates my soul/Shatters my heart every time /Mindful of my strength
Gods with glowing boughs / ruby, amber, sparkling rime / beckon in the woods
Cool air and crisp sheets, Cleansed city all washed clean, Thank you scary storm.
Guardian Angels / still tender to their plots in / a carving of wings
Did we connect, friend? / Love exchanged but joy escaped. / Hope carries us forth.
[cough] Yoyo played Bach [haiku may need some filler] just as Bach played him
Adrift in wonders/ As life passes before me/ hath I enjoyed it?
The most precious gem / is unearthed from a mother / instead of the dirt.
How do I hate thee / leave me my own devices / and I’ll count the ways /
That snowy silence/the still cold air feels breathless/a calm peaceful chill
The dark sky of night / Is illuminated by / The pale crescent moon.
Moon-dust coated glimmer/ wisp of light, star-trail shimmer/ the face of a dream
Here...today...really? / In plain sight but I missed it! / Unveiled by our love.
Here...today...really? / In plain sight but I missed it! / Unveiled by our love.
I’ve a simple need/ a faithful front porch hound-dog / howling for what’s mine
Apricot footlights / and a tangerine glow have / lit the forest floor
A 40-day pass / alleluia vacations / glorias relax
Screaming everywhere / No one but me can hear it / Auditory ghosts.
Empowered by grace, / my love poured out for you dear. / Glory, praise to God!
The universe plays/ I think it used you to laugh/ out your rhinestoned mouth
Crinkling wrapper / dog instantly in kitchen / hope springs eternal
a clear objective/ dominate haiku font page/ with Marbles content
One hundred lashes/ One hundred coats of lipstick/ Sixteen Million views
neglected puppy/ will never grow to full height/ watair your cermet
a bare brow shivers/ What will she do to me next?/ she writes OH HELL YEAH
shades on, velvet suit/ Can't you see I'm leisuring?/ loudly sipping wine
Losing my marbles/ Is she a chair or toothbrush?/ need moar videos
A forlorn switch of / twilight in the cawing of / daylight savings crows
Emotions swirling. / So dizzy, no way to stop. / Joy comes from faith, hope.
Brief exuberance/purple jacaranda tears/paint the old footpath
At the end of fall / Plumage on the horizon / Blossoms in the cold
I have the pleasure/ Of seeing you in dreams when/ Distance divides us.
The dinner guest has / a preference from carving / and gobbling a bird
The dinner guests have / a preference from carving / and gobbling a bird
Savor your time here / For it will deplete quickly / Live without regrets
Earth worm on pavement / Lost in a cold heartless world / Who will intervene
The storm comes stalking / lightning, thunder, wind, and rain / washing us away
Imbalance...good, bad. / Focus ever on the bad. / Good is my focus.
I no longer cry / But it’s not that I don’t feel / I feel way too much
Is a haiku re / ally just cutting words mid sen / tence to get the count
I’m as faithful as / you have ever seen. Call me / a front porch hound dog.
This is for me now/ my time and place in this life/ will grow and sprout joy.
Don't paint the rainbow/ it's colors are everywhere /experience it.
You are a whirlwind / Picking up the sun-dried earth / Bringing it to life
A country in two / Should not be bound by party / But by common good
Melted, when we kissed /// Been waiting for you, my fears /// Longed for touch and love
Had another day / Longing to become myself / Over, under, tie
Your thighs pull my eyes / Like gravity pulls the tides / You have a nice moon

Computers for peace/Program developers should/Declare Var, not War
On November 6/Vote Cat. That is all, there is/No more to be said
Computers for peace/Application developers/Declare Var, not War
Things didn’t work out/But you made me who I am./I love you, you bitch.
Haunting for candy / ghostly apparitions in / their well-mannered sheets
Read minds women wish / Men could do this little trick / Space, signs, hints. Finished.
So for October I had a haiku for each day. Now that it's done I figured I'd share
Have a toke, stick man. / Empty my rack, take a chance. / Cold bones to the wind...
Cheap vampire fangs / and fake, cherry flavored blood / I vant your candy
Support the people / that live with risk all the time / their needs dwarf your wants
Love - we chose this day. / Love - amidst the evil tide. / Love - conquers and leads.
Love song
Golden sands sit calm/ Where the moon meets the ocean/ The cycle complete
Got the blue sky blues/I'm only happy when I'm sad/What a twisted mind
its life, play the game / without you its not the same / one o'clock, its me..
Echoes of the past/ I will not pull this trigger/ time to be silent

Got a new hoopty / Cruising so phat down the block / How much were those rims?
Trying to find truth / Semi-combustible lapse / Do I find it here?
Big words mean much more / Halitosis advancement / No hermeneutics
A pure fiery spirit lies/At the back of my little eyes/Not all could sense it.
Haiku
Purpose singular / The blossom spreads her petals / The bees ignore her
The drum of his heart/ Beat through fists, already she/ Picks out a coffin
Compartmentalize / all the aspects of our lives / without knowing why
Startled by a bee/ Mistaken for a flower/ Rest your wings my dear
Dogs have dirty minds; / they will never fail to see / 50 shades of gray
We turn from the sun / And the trees withdraw their sap / Small lives are ending
Water washed me clean / Spirit filled my soul this day / Seventy years back
Lungs fill with fresh air / Snails crawl on the morning grass / Where I want to be.
The summers warm breeze-/Nestled under the trees shade/There is inner peace
The bow grows heavy/The arrows- they have grown dull/This spring was his last
Little bird take flight-/The cold breeze guides your way south/To bring forth new life
Little bird
Gnarled and bent old tree/ Rime and squall forge hallowed nooks/ Haven for new life
Coming soon...
grating dulcet tones/I hope that ambient noise/fucking destroys you
Your words to Your loves / Only with grace can I speak / Tears of joy follow
Pushing not working / Tugged a certain direction / Pulled to destiny
If I ever smiled/it has mixed with the raindrops/unwashable stain
Dewdrops on black grass / My thumb collects the river / Wipe her tear away
if you show your claws/ you cannot pick the flower/ only scars will show
a tree has fallen / but its fall was never heard / did it make a sound?
(REQUEST) Can someone write a beautiful haiku about a girl named Bekah, and possibly about how much I love her?
In this day and age/ you cannot trust anyone/ always turn your back
Closed windows / against autumn chill / beef stew simmering
the equaliser/the task at hand with eyes closed/cosmic impacts loom
A cool milky moon / spills through an open doorway / she drinks in silence.
Such foul disbelief. / The misery never relieves. / Lamb seeks for penance.
Twenty four frames / a second, still not enough / pictures of you.
Forever glimmering/Mirrors looked in by the gods/How perfect lakes are
So hard, forgiveness / So close...just a step to start / So precious your grace
Particles and waves / black holes and supernovae / it’s all just poetry.
Stardust sandcastles / This fix in betwixt our eyes / Endlessly inward

Poetry is real / The only comfort I know / If it just made cash...
Scorned and lost at sea / Wishing a one-eyed cyclops / Would just kidnap me
Blood vessels branch out / from frozen hearts and grey flesh / black trees of winter.
Young man's dream to fly/ perched into a woman's eye/ too nervous to jump
Goblins in my skin / Haiku so hard it hurts me / I cried and wrote this
I need some new pants / Although I did just get some / A new hat instead
Walls, can you hear me? / The trees weren't talking either / Everyone hates me
Someone's shoes not mine / Inhabit my cold, dead feet / I need Doctor Scholl's
Plastic men follow / Black suits, sunglasses, sharp shoes / These are giveaways
Say that I'm not me / I'm the one who said that though / Woah, that's too deep man
A coat-wearing man / Saw me in the rain, he said / "Yeesh, you sure look rough."
Strange new ideas, wait / Where have I heard that before? / Did I think of that?
Restless jab at keyboard/Lady in blue caught my eye/Haiku on the anvil
Milking dairy juice / Fettered but yet still free, aww / Simple joys in life

When she doesnt call / Everything sounds like your phone / Ringing in your head
A truth like water / Flows through cracks in your story / Discovers its shape
Made by Milkweed for / the king of caterpillars / the Monarch muffler
Rolling up to flames / and stretching out a neck it / was spouting for life
Slouching willow tree / Rigid against the strong gusts / An umbrella falls
Side by side...how sweet / Love shared is love remembered / Celebrating us
red rises in me / sharp apparatus meets wrist / will i greet first light?
disconnecting veins / my only escape from here / am i worth mending?
Why is it that death/will only lend what life is/compelled to borrow?
The bull is set free. He is the moon. And the moon? It is now the sea.

Wind sweeps me away / to resist is foolishness/ thus I choose to fly
Much weakness showing / Mighty strength to move forward / Built from fortitude
Steep hill before us / Friends, together we will climb / God, guides and provides
Time moves so slowly / when I’m sitting here alone / missing you dearly
Every night it stares / through open windows, grinning / and gnashing it's teeth.

A day to love, serve / Stone easily trips...I fall / Father, thanks for your hand

There's nothing sweeter / Than having the taste of you / Stained upon my lips
Twenty-five karma / Way too few for seven years / The lurker's cake day
sunlit bubbling beer / cigarette smoke and tattoos - / football's coming home.
Addiction worships / hymnals in hallucinate / Patron Saint of Fix
Still cool on dark lake / the flash of a kingfisher / the moment is gone
Your pain, my concern / Caring and praying for you / Hearts, lives, united
Before the warm red coat/Golden feathers adorned/My chicken dinner
Power to choose fate / Destiny ahead of them / Making the right choice

The smell of rain just / Before it rains; the concrete / And my childhood.
The rain sings to me/ I sleep while water whispers/ tonight, it's quiet
Awoke at midnight / Thunder banging at my door / Zeus is drunk again
A maple stands / Where the sky begins / And I end.
You plant happiness / In my sad, sixteen-ounce world / Gardener Angel
You really know / How to bring out the beauty / In the disasters
Vengeance takes a steed / Holy fires seize their season / And nature recedes
I am Alistor / I draw candid conclusions / like double-edged swords.
When I'm far away/ from the people who love me / I feel kind of free.
Spider's eyes / In the grass shimmer / like the stars.
Reincarnation
Hot ashes drift down / blanketing the earth with snow / for our last winter.
I dream of drowning / I feel no fear or sadness / only acceptance.
Fighters were wrestling / in their anaconda grip / hosing down the fire
Long after I've gone / trees whisper to each other / with unheard echoes

Uninhibited / Please be nothing more than raw / Honest and truthful
quality content / give only a few upvotes / cats give too many
Metaphorical/Oedipus's patricide/Blinded his compass
The summer arrives/Taking from me an old friend/And leaving tulips
A dartboard of bugs / sticking in the frame of an / arachnid's bulls-eye
He lowers his blinds / then after fifteen minutes / he raises them, flushed.
“Gone” - Fight the break of dawn/Girl you know I’ve got to go/Tomorrow I’ll be...
Softly humming friend/gently setting the cheesecake/refrigerator.
Along the canal / a mother snaps a swan's neck, / her son's pale face blanks.
These words they choke me/like a vine around my throat/creeping from my heart
I’ll always be kind/ If I have remind you/ I’ll be by your side
Your pain shapes my tears / Join me on this pilgrimage / Do not be afraid
If you can read this\ I will tell you a secret\ I do so see you
Bethesda E3 2018 Haiku Review!
Everything good fades / I'm anchored in this bad place / I need to get out.
Memory of you / your smell lingers on my coat / illusions of you
Grief. It's all the love/you want to give but could not./It's really just love.
Annoying as hell / Always trying to steal food / Pooping everywhere
I wrote you again / I still await your response / I still await you
Enormous pressure. / Flood waters threaten to burst /No release. Dammed
The river flows to / the sea would that it / would carry me thus
Still water at night / Deceptively dangerous / Stagnated silence
My heart beat quickens/ Life is to short to stop now/ Bliss as our lips touch
Cottonwood pollen/Falls like the devil’s dandruff/ Dancing in the breeze
forbidden knowledge / the alchemist family / became king of kings
This is a haiku / But it has nothing to say / Mogami river
A heavy rain comes / You used to clear my dark clouds / But where are you now?
With oceans between/Our dreams and reality/We will march onward.
What the future holds/noone knows in certainty /so why be afraid
Tomorrow
A single yip had / set off the yowling and it / avalanched through yards
A single yip had / set off the howling and it / avalanched through yards
Stormy's tantrum is / tottering trees and flinging / rain at the branches
Oh sugar sugar/Shawty you’re my candy girl/The kind with the swirls
Nowadays we're dams/ we're all gonna burst at once/ try turn on a tap
Such perfect weather / Thank you, Lord, for this moment / A glimpse of heaven
I get knocked down. But / I get up again, never / Gonna keep me down.
running from despair / forget about the lighter / stop to the orgasm
Stormy's tantrum is / tottering trees and flinging / rain from the branches
Lips that once were sweet / and tender have given way / to a tongue so sharp
This is not a haiku . . .
The bow cuts through froth, / an angry blade breaking waves. / A Humpback follows.
cloudy days
Love,friendship,highly valued concepts./Once those concepts are put to test./They're nothing but that,concepts.
Faith can be tested / and it will sometimes fail / but it will return
That's a girl I know/must keep staring to know/the answer was no
Open, honest, fresh / Love filled each moment with you / Again is my hope
Courage softens the / Ground beneath intrepid feet / As we launch skyward
Comfort in Routine
Loved when you are born / Nothingness you shall return / Time to eat some corn
I feel so enraged / I can't draw the way I want / Thanks, Microsoft Paint.
"Nothing is permanent."
It's that time year. / eyes leak, nose drips, throat itch. / I hate hayfever.
You look like art when / You smile in my direction / Priceless. Beautiful.
Hand-in-hand, shore-side, / bands of color through the mist. / Red lips stain my cheek.
Ageing is funny/ we find new ways to fuck up/ as we go along
The rains torment me / Droplets and downpours, they both / Turn cold my feelings.
A crayon station / was set up for relief in / the Kool-Aid treatment
End times call for end / Measures mean nothing to the / Heart wants what it wants
Sometimes stone forgets / It is supposed to be still / Then mountains grow red
Prison guards are kind, the cigarettes you give them, remind them of this
Oh what a pleasure / to see trees lining my path / of discovery.
Often we have loved / Ever bound, body, spirit / Journey united
I was on my way/ when I saw him on the side/ my purpose then changed
Cup of tea, no cakes- Under this shabby tin roof Trimmed green tea fields.
Last year was the year / Halloween wasn’t that fun / Feeling older now
It never ends here, / binks into the stratosphere. / Fecundity rules.
After sixteen years / finally able to start / paying stundent dept.
Loosely braided stems / a dainty crown for a queen / small yellow stained hands.
I worry too much / Hope that doesn't bother you / It is how I am
I worry about all things. It is how I am. Hope that doesn't bother you.
Stop looking those joyful people./And let me sing you a song/Of death and everlasting misery.
Bumblebees fly low, / swollen legs above tall grass. / A redbreast cries foul.

Those in glass houses/shouldn't throw stones/or masturbate in the daytime
Some days we dread it / being alone is human / some days we need it.
Lies and deception, / songs that cause the crowd to bleed. / Guts spill on pavement.
Wiping a green tear / she closed their Mantis doors and / tip-toed from her sac
Losing its charm the / gauging of a bracelet is / permanent pigment
The last warm sunset / dapples a young wounded deer / Autumn's sacrifice.
Some people in this world/Just aren't meant to carry these things/Called being loved and joy
Heavy sighs and gasps / An intertwined mess of limbs / Releasing tension
here before you came / here after you are long gone / it’s not a contest
The wind may blow strong / But I will stand tall and calm / The storm will soon end
Cats and dogs cry out / People shout, cars whine, dreams die / Shut up everyone!
Tiger's Eyes held high, / a halcyon sea of pride. / Raindrops on my tongue.
The wind may blow strong / But I will stall and calm / The storm will end soon
I'm just so fucking scared \ I think im going insane \ but its in my head
Today your light shined / Memories of days lived, loved / More today I pray
The Mountains Humming \ Crisp, the Air Sings Relinquō \ the Saddened Earth Sleeps
Just so far away / The place to call home in dreams / Must get there somehow
Lips that once traded / kisses in a love so pure / are full of hate now

I feel like a meal / for mosquito and deer fly. / Oar blades pull from shore.
Tragedy it seemed / Awakening it was though / Happiness will come
Story touched my heart / Reflected, penetrated / Much to ponder now
I feel so sadly/ I want to tell him badly/ I love him madly
The winds feel weird. There / are no clouds, though. Still feels like / a big storm coming.

live your life between / come and go ; the ebb and flow / lost in these seconds
the brightness descends / shadows fade; warm winds prevail / I'm falling awake
Religion feeds ignorance/Clutching a book never read/You’re the problem
To you, everything / is a spider leg broken / off above the knee.
Mosquitoes buzz near / sticky red Popsicle hands / tasty summer treat.

Writing a paper / I'm still procrastinating / On Reddit Four hours
And if you can't be / with the one you love, honey / love the one you're with

Evening
Bustling white sidewalks / displaced coyotes howl / slink through midnight streets.
You are the crashing / Of the ocean waves and the / Smell of salty air

The Storm (haiku, tanka, haiku)
Ambulance siren / For whom does it hurry now / It hurries for me
There’s a deafening / “I love you” in a silent / Morning kiss and hug
Silence broke itself / under the weight of your words / the echoes still ring
As you walked past me/ I can smell honeysuckle/ A bittersweet scent
your soft lips on mine / arms wrapped around your body / don’t want to wake up
There I found myself / On the edge of the water / As I drink deeply
The bow cuts through froth, / an angry blade breaking waves. / A Humpback follows.
You were present In every thought, word, deed Your love...perfect
Everyone thinks / it's five seven five / but in reallife / it's four five four five
Sanguine afternoons / Pass like trees on the highway / Nights like the mountains
a few thousand bees / vomiting drops of nectar / for your banana
There is no more love / You don't talk and shut me out / She was my kid too
Panting on a twig / the battered bug body and / crimped antenna won
My face, flushing red/ Dark thoughts are inside my head/ Want to see you dead
Shuddered at the thought/ Of young losing their lives, and/ mothers losing them
My wounds left unhealed/ Employed time as my doctor/ Still, I am bleeding
Man-made wings, raise me/ Up to the clouds where I have/ joy and happiness
Hand-in-hand, shore-side, / bands of color through the mist. / Red lips stain my cheek.

If this peace is real / Let me collect my thoughts quick / Then all life is fake
Death my ancient friend / I have come for you again / Guide my frail hand
I want to believe/ In Thelma to my Louise/ or Laverne, Shirley
Perhaps in falling / I'm also gaining the speed / To fly by myself
Love can be a harsh / reminder of who we are. / A bruise on my face.
When I was younger / I thought love was a feeling / when it was a choice
Sun-bleached cattle skull / a novel decoration / but, it smells like death
Words of defiance / Praying your dreams are pleasant / Loving you always
Peacefully I go, / drowned in a sea of faces, / lungs filled with small talk

Formation foretold / with Mares' Tail flicking the sky / and swishing for rain
Tears bond us / Joy propels each step together / Energized by love
Unless you know me / I appear to you, my friend / A contradiction
The midwestern wave / our paths cross on country roads / fingers leave the wheel

Sense of self be gone / Born anew of inner being / New peace from within
In front of the door / A key made of ice and hopes / Two locks — you ready?
Angler of my heart/ I don't mind suffocating/Hanging on your line
The sun is angry / I breathe desiccated earth / The sky hoards water
Dry country prevails / the drought years of history / threaten to return

My daughter hates me/ I brought her into this world/ but I gave her up
Found yourself falling/ Because there were hints of care/ Imagination.
Fleeting form of joy/ Gone in a blink of an eye/ Ethereal you
Took refuge under/ A celebration of leaves/ Wanting a reprise
The carnal hunger / for coffee cakes and dark brews / battle-stained apron
The town didn’t change / the streets are in the same place / but it’s not the same
Cooking is so hard / The lunchpack of Notre Dame / Edible monster.

A forest of trees / for the Nazarene have been / sprouting up in lots
You have conquered all/which others have done to you/don't lose to yourself

Hey everybody / The Procrastinators Club / Will not meet Thursday.

She waits locked away/ Thoughts fleeting, nectar dripping/ He slips in the key
Like a metaphor / similes are an ocean / meaning drowns if deep
Hummers dance and whirl/ Just a sip sustains their speed/ honeysuckle blooms
Through the spilled ink and / Overused words I try to / Make sense of my thoughts
Swirls of pink and white/ Petals of chrysanthemum/ scattered on the ground

A haiku about going for a walk
It's not slavery / Because it has extra steps / Hence no sympathy
All traffic equal / House of Representatives / Follow Senate's lead
Repeal defeated / Maintaining neutrality / Ajit's nose bloodied
Let me sleep
Dandelion clocks / Faded tattoos and sweet tea / I still remember
Songbird jives the wind/freeflow compost remembers/dank marijuana
Albums of old love/Pictures of babies and trips/Where is my scrapbook?
To be or not be / Life is a calamity / Poison, dagger, sleep.

Spilled Ink and Overused Words
Humid city nights/ continuously shuffling/ of feet on asphalt
I feel so confused/looking for answers using/trial and error.
She smiles in English / I count my heartbeats in French / parley vous Anglais?
Waiting for the bus / I'm struck by nihilism / And then by the bus.
Penny for my thoughts? / No thoughts worth considering / I'm done - keep the change
Just breathe in and out/mist is swirling in the air-/a youth pandemic
Cette nuit en Paris/Tu as découvris mon coeur/Puis l’as enflammé
Handing the baton / Hold firm my faithful friends / Our joy...success!
Ruaisuhr
Cotton candy sky/Pink skies: a sailor’s delight/Hope for better days
Standing by the street / Where I am tied to a horse / "Giddy-up", I say.
A calming haze blooms/Gentle sky clears for sunshine/Spring blossoms sweetly
Feeling helpless now/ Tiny fragile seeds of Fall/ Summer brings sweet fruit
Weathered every rack / But the prize sought was not won / Fallen cold and dead.

#Brevity / In short, a way to say much while saying little.
Anxiety
Sunshine, warmth...NICE! / For a time, goodbye cold. / Enjoying each day.
a breeze lifts the flag / and shakes the flowers below - / I invite it in
Just walking slowly/ As rain clouds cover the sky/ The wet millipede
The guy in the sky / Ain’t alive, he must have died / Or it’s all a lie
And then it hit me / Awful is the best there is / Also a bullet
My soul shall outlast Miseries/ And My dreams shall outlast my Soul.
I checked the fridge for / the 15th time and realized that it / doesn't spawn any new food
Like a fleeting dawn, waking from a wondrous dream, leaves a loss that fades.
Everything changes / The first time you hold your child / Ethereally
light through bubbling beer / smoke curling from shisha pipes / - the square soaked in sun
Lightning decided / For no apparent reason / To hit the old man.
one too many beers / we need a proctologist! / sack of cucumbers
haiku
My laundry pocket / held September's note when the / acorn had dropped in
I'm weak and weary / Merely this and nothing more / Let my heart be still.
Your sun-kissed tanned skin/ my sweet caramel goddess/ dessert for the eyes
Remembering love expressed / Unbreakable, eternal is our bond / Tears of joy
Ev'ry little thing / Can stick together until you / Want just one thing - weed.
When I hear you sing/ Heart dances to the rhythm/ Of your melody
her hands on the wheel / he, the passenger, watches / her bare thighs at work
On a mother’s day / the motherfuckers buy gifts / that arrive too late
Road curving ahead / Considering my options / Could keep going straight.
her hands on the wheel / he, the passenger, watching / her bare thighs at work
Back in my dorm room / I left my dildo in the / refrigerator
Breezing in for lunch / crunchy potato salad / and swallowing sand
the brave little frog / jumped quickly across the road / hop hop hop hop squish.
Sweats in summer nights/ Lights out to keep them away/ The flying termites
Long the preparation / Short, swift the final days / Proceed with trust
Self isolation / You push everyone away / So they can't hurt you
A thought is a crime / Never, but fascists don't care / 'Cos jail's bad enough.
Trembling in desire / You tease me with your fingers / Deadly is your touch
Kentucky St, McKinney TX, 9:57pm
Solar power is / Celestial source of life /Renewable hope
Clouds lapping the sky / and a star parasailing / under crescent moon
Unwavering love/ This is what I feel for you/ Till my dying breath
You, me, together/ Staring at the moonlit sky/ Heartbeats are in sync
You, me, together/ Staring at the moonless sky/ Heartbeats are in sync
Young bamboo shoots / rising from mounds of rich soil / full of green vigor
Colorful insects / reflect the spectrum of light / eyes seeing wonder
Just two waves joining / crashing chaotic ocean / then peaceful once more
A tree's shade / cool summer breeze / warm sunlight
Sitting here with you/ Every sweeping glance you make/ Takes my breath away
Obsolescence by design / Each day...signs of failure / How long, Lord?
I’m over the moon/ I’ve been to the sun and back/ I’m in love with you
I need some insight / Inspiration for my work / Send suggestions, please
A Stereotype/ A Blonde Haired, Blue-Eyed Surprise/ Why Do I Love You?
A loving mother / closed their mantis doors and then / tiptoed from her sac
I slept like garbage / I should staple my eyes shut / Sun won't shine anymore
Celestial pilot / Turned down through midnight abyss / Accursed gates now home
Wet prostitute / Walking home / In the rain.
painting your portrait / I gyrate my hips and howl / canvas remains blank
Distraction...Diversion...Interruption / Prayer restores focus on goal / Grace received...thanks!
Spring
Butt-fucked / "It's just like as turd/ coming in"
Has our short spring past?/ Frost on the rose/ Yet the birds sing for me.
How could she have died? / She was so beautiful / Golden, Blushing Bride
A father and son / on a get-together walk / chatted to their phones
Tires hiss in the rain / Downturned faces walking home / Together alone
Medieval fights / on fields with Purple Martins / lancing dragonflies
He hid like she did/a mirror to her facade/it was unpleasant
Having the Answers / Inquisitive by nature / Knowing the Unknown
Surrender to pain/the waves come in and then go/you have held your own.
There will come a day / When the last bridge collapses / Yet the river flows.
I love haiku- / So much more than / Rainbows.
Accept the hard Truth / Scrolling is the New Smoking / and there is no cure

Life quickly sprouting / Flaming hope within my soul / Overcomes the darkness
A TASTE, not enough/ ALWAYS precious/ RARITY is beautiful
Amalgamation / A mix of man and metal / Move mound and mountain
Drifting downward the / steeple had nearly punctured / a floating blue moon
匍匐, creeping
blaze of glory / like any other rental / i treat this body
The roar of the falls / and time spent falling asleep / what it takes to jump
At the wishing well / Yesterday you were crying / And today you smile.
I hear your name in / Silence and I see your face / In an empty room
haiku
The wind and the tree/dance and sing all through the night/morning brings silence
Deep the memories / Currents of time so swift / Loving our journey
Caught in this cycle/you'd think I'd learn by now/still nothing to show
sitting still feeling / more like a thousand spinning / on a rock in space
Glorious mountain An energetic run stings in spite of the king

Bright eyes, sharpened talons / Feathers mute sounds of approach / Owl catches its prey
A map, a compass/ Even with these things, I can't/ Find my place in you
The cold wind blows hard/ Against a weak, little plant/ Uprooting it all
Beyond hills and streams/ There lies a lush green meadow/ Full of life and glee
On the windowsill / Poking stinger now is stilled / Knightly flyer killed
Parental fights choked / nutrients of peace and love / so he uprooted
Memories are lost/leaves fluttering on the wind/autumn overwhelms
A bite, not enough/hunger rising/the flower elusive.

Autumn haiku's #2
My eyes burn sometimes/but wisdom is in the mind/I am never blind
Night falls upon us / A maiden crosses my path / Her allure calls to me
Head is spinning, eyes/Are hurting - goodbye Facebook/Time to let you go!
Are we just echoes-- / parroting their words and deeds? / We can be better.
Memories of hugs / given and received, my love, / warms my heart and soul.
Lips on my breast bone/ Fingers pull tightly on hair/ We join together
warm tea inside us / dishwasher hum in our ears / she smiles like starlight
Removing the space / from a normal sentence / destroys its meaning
She's a broken girl/Living in a world unknown/Lost in her own mind
Dolphins in the sea / Delicious shells and seaweed / It was a condom
Painful memories / Each more crushing than the last / I drink to forget
Warmth sneaks unbidden/Into my heart, stirring up/Feelings long thought dead.
How did you know it? / Wisdom from the innocent! / Lord, how my soul sings.
She must have gone mad // I'm almost certain, because // She said she loves me
Two plus two is four // Minus one that's three, Quick Maths // I said man's not hot
I don't understand / what your motivation is / to suffocate me
"No! Don't make me jump!" / Wide-eyed, she stared from the plane. / First time sky-diving.
Behind my glass wall/Untouched and untouchable/Watching others live.
A dream turned into / An unending nightmare by / Forgotten safe-words.
Viscous pools of red / Matted hair across the floor / I try to see more
When I peer outside // the sonder overwhelms me.// I hide in myself.
I feel someone comes/but behind me, only leaves/rolling on concrete.
Bones encased in ice/Snowy cold exterior/Nothing gets inside
Your error. My pain. / How I want to dry the tears. / Prayers now for us.
Why am I alive? / An existential crisis / quickly summarized.
In a sleepless haze/ Silent rain storms my rooftop/ I count each droplet
The time has arrived / For your descent into hell / Please stand on the right
last night's snow / and half a dead mouse--/ santa claws
Lying on the ground / Reaching out towards the sky / How I long to fly
A tree in a town;/ Green against grey, till winter,/ Now dead as the rest.
A thief came to me / Who didn’t steal my petty wealth / But my heart instead.
Mild entertainment / lovely chapel / amen
Photos - remember? / Moments of joy, hope and us. / Our covenant lived.
Trees must grow then rot / The past fades and future strays / Now is all we've got
Lying awake in bed / reading a novel / feeling bad for Carrie
i find it funny / when people rise up from hell / you see why they fell
Gurgle and churning / Stomach tossing and turning / Chemo can bite me
Love flows from your heart / Your kindness brightens my day / You make me happy
Effervescent lights/shimmer, speaking vast knowledge/the cosmos laid bare
This time of dark cold. / Give thanks for warmth and shelter. / Hearth fired by your love.

fear of pregnancy / that's why I opt for anal / with men, just in case
Your joy overflowed. / Bright was the sonshine inside. / A glimpse of heaven.
What does it say about me, that all my inspiration is borne of pain?
Boats fighting over / Stormy waters, slowly but / Surely, losing ground.
because I'm Irish / you supplant my genitals / with a cocktail shrimp
Cold rain pours outside./It pours warm in the shower./But none can rinse you.

People don't like me. I bring out the worst in them. Maybe it's their fault.

A controversy / I must say I love it / Don't you love it too?
I'm he which you seek/ the bearer of your vices/ devil of your hell
I killed all the ants / So beautiful when they're dead / Now I must clean them
Kill the little ants / They're everywhere and are cute / I must kill them all
My sister is a damn idiot
Exquisite delights, sweaty summer days and nights, unbearable lust.
In the winds of change / A sudden transformation / Become ultimate
Do not run from death / Cold winds fly through this great cliff / Darkness surrounds all
To beat the reaper / One must live the fullest life / Not the longest life

pale phosphorescence/ from the glass of grapefruit juice/ on a summer morn

Down in the deep dark/Deeper they go always down/In Earth the deep dwarves....
On the misty lake/The visions of ages long past/Still doth lurk yonder....
In a series of / Ones and zeros we collide / Longing for less space
Your sleepy breath a / Metronome against my skin / Reinventing time.
Big picture, hidden / The pieces of a puzzle / Connecting them all
grappling for a thought / dark blue beyond the window / abducts the senses

Failure is common / so fail at some wild dreams first / then, settle for less.
scaling up and up / abyss, fingers cross: through keys / jump over thumbs down
The real nightmare
flowing river... pebbles lie on flower bed
An ode to Indiana
Even if you fail / Just to fall flat on your face / Get up - try again!
Love is...

It is cold inside/My mind sits under dark clouds/The sun dries me out
I made you an app / Where haiku travel the world / Contribute your verse
traffic jam - and again, down again / rain spatter ran
Decisive moment / So capable of changing / The key turning point
This reality/All my dreams have woken up/I'll never be great
sweet voice by my ear/soft kisses surround my heart/I love, the first time
just smile, you peasant / even if you don't mean it / that's the fucking point.
Newborn baby says / To double-hearted mother / Now you're on your own
Fire burns within/ Passion turns into a blaze/ I will fan the flames
Thin voices through wall / too cold to answer sleep's call / might read tokyo ghoul

True Haiku
blue sunny morning: chirping birds and wind whistling. from bed, a mourning
The courage to live / Destiny in your own hands / Luxury of choice
steam rises upwards / leaving behind impurity / rebirth, such is life
Sun's been gone for days / Dark clouds with no break in sight / Birds are still out though
On the mound of crap/ a lone kernel of corn lay/ only it prevails
from the mound of crap/ a lone kernel of corn lay/ only it prevails
another pint, sir / my death by misadventure / on the horizon
Four weeks, no classes/What to do with precious time/Before it passes
You can kill two birds / with one stone, or just watch them / and be happier
Up at 6A.M./Pale light squirms through the windows/He hopes to sleep soon
To find your purpose / Focusing on the journey / Reaching the main goal
"I DO deserve this"/ The comfort eater's mantra/ Saturated fats
The sunburned wall face/ Stands at ease for centuries/ Throughout the mountains.
Sunburned Great Wall
buzzes the led bug - frog's tongue loose flies / but buzzing goes fry
The sky is now clear, / we bask in shades of deep blue / Shiva, we feel you.
My top-heavy heart / swells only to fall over / and over, again
Be a kind person / and easily, you'll make friends / rarely, the right ones
A housefly buzzes / it's dead now. That's life, I guess / inside these windows
Always biding time / Taking too long for a move / Just go for it now!
Hip hip hop to the/ hip hip hop. Hip hip hop and / you know it don't stop
Need new contacts / Better choose wisely / A new religion

Memories are pain/The Sun is out, yet it rains/Everything will fade
Avoidance of eyes/Tremor in the autumn wind/Gaze of apathy
Martin Place
these delicate eyes / held back tears upon a word / voiced so suddenly
these delicate eyes / held back tears upon a word / uttered suddenly
fine sunny day - coffin lies down / anyway
Breaking points take place / But holding it together / One’s resolve tested
Staring silently/Canvas defiled from paint/The artist gives up.
in love with the now / i do not need memories / adult luxury
smoke, stones - homeless crackheads / fight back
Forgetting, it's like/ Holes into an empty house/ Abandoned, hopeless...
Call, Call of the void/ See him rising from the tide/ Madness made matter
We sit in silence/ wondering, why do we mourn/ for only our dead
These are your hands, flint/ Now strike the tinder of art/ Light your legacy
chunk of blue sky / by the window - coffee break
Screws, knives, rusted things; / Left behind in your garage. / I am where you were. // Your tackle box, Channellocks, / Are where you left them. / Just me and the rust.
ran over something / felt the thump, too dark to see / boy does my butt itch
A pilgrim abroad / Coarse sand in secondhand shoes / Dreams of peace at home.
Gears in head spinning / Just so many ideas/ Thinking to the max
Mists on the Hudson, / dreary to some, tonight, there / can't be more to love.
Bending low, he cries / the prince mourns his now lost bride / the ladybug flies.
dark sky - shimmering lights / below
Our own.
dark sky - shimmering lights / bellow
Pink petals scattered / but I recall her lessons / in saying “yellow”.
Cold evening drive / lonely, dark, and vicious road / Beautiful sunrise
my mind has killed me / and lives now in your temple / i just haunt myself
three lines cannot say / any less than my whole heart / they are both useless
Old, spiral notebook / Budgets, love notes, our best plans / Half written; torn out.
summer's blinding heat/ winter in a broken heart/ tepid soul fallout/
she is not concerned / about his room being neat / she'd lie in clothes piles
-What are these haikus-and how do you make these things-explainlikeimfive-
You flirted with death - no matter what I told you - one too many times.
Though good intentions / All ambitions need action / To do more than dream
like glass raindrops cut/ Begin descent; behind me/like raindrops glass falls
autumn of ardour/ not a matter of ease yet/ you I want to love/
spring has come alone/ without the birds in tow/ morose, the birch waits/
lake in the road - all clouds, they shake / under tires load

Coo coo, mourning dove / Coo your little heart out. Coo! / Just don't poop on me.
I hate how it sounds / With the music turned way down / Too vulnerable
I don't have any kids / But I like making dad jokes / I am a faux pa
Desert wind, hot, dry / draws the scent of a river / from budding green trees
Clinging to something / Just refusing to let go / Sometimes, it’s OK
meds aren't working / nicotine gum is not real / very few things are
gazing out my window/ I wonder when a baby tree/ will blossom tender leaves
Unblossomed tulips/Standing in a dusky field/Waving in the sun.

I kick out my chair/ Noose around neck, knife in hand /Hanging, i stab my heart
I Am So Afraid/ Of How Unpredictable/ The Future Can Be
We became enslaved/by the audio they grew/in their soundgarden
Death is an old door / Locked and worn the wrought handle / Startled by silence
The lines on her face / Are like a map of her soul-- / The moments she's lived.
What you are?
We can still be friends / But it will be different / What about our plans?
Bashir al-Assad / He is our savior and god / For him, we must plod
Even at your worst / Never an eternal state / To strive for your best
The night is quiet/A letter came in today/The stars are calming
You would dance with Death/Mindful of his sharpened scythe/Soon for your reaping

a car parks for oil / black blood flooding its life back - blood back from red soil
the stars and moon watched; / blushed as two imperfect souls / loved and became one
two birds
excited atoms / connection of emotions / action at distance
I cannot go on / You; loving life without me / Me; slowly fading.
Just stop thinking dear/ Stop counting the memories / Let it go, be free
we're clean out of love/ you tell me this, turn, and sleep / I jack off wildly
Pen of faith in hand / Writing out one’s own story / A happy ending
I'm dreaming again / I smell birch forest in Spring / then wake up, it's gone.
Roll into Compton/ like a loose cannon. Smokin'/ big green Bruce Banner.

The past is alive / Wouldn’t change it if I could / I’ve no right to it
Haiku
Online friends often / Fade away when they are not / online any more.
needs are persitent / I detest my lack of pride / when you accept me
You rejected me/I tried to get over you/I'll never succeed
Not lucky. (w/comic)
Run Run!
With faith in yourself / Fueled with steadfast resolve / Brilliance in motion
Cut off some choices / Make THE single decision / Major turning point
You died, but asked for / More time. You don’t remember, / But here’s your more time.

I may have missed it / if I'd taken the freeway — moon cresting mountains
I carry around / a box of melancholy / it gets out sometimes
on a sailing ship / I've not done gay stuff, I quipped / but that was soon fixed
this cube is haunted / nerd ghosts materialize / searching for sliderules
White Album playing / While My Guitar Gently Weeps / George, RIP Mate

An actual dream / Filled entirely with hope / The ongoing chance
An Apple tree swoons /Mid-harvest leaves falling down / Like rain on my cheeks
To the car he runs / A yearning for freedom lost / laziness at home
Capable of much / To realize one’s talent / Beyond powerful
The night becomes light/The dawn is now upon us/Your fate awaits you.
jacksfilms on youtube/ hooked me on his haiku theme/ now i can't stop help
My final paper/ referencing was needed/ 10k is too much
Emotions in flux / Further frustration mounting / A deep breath needed
I had a good time / I'm glad that we didn't fight / We could be just friends.
I might have missed it / if I'd taken the freeway -- moonrise over mountains
A cycle.
falling apart / a 'lost dog' poster / soaked with rain
distant songbird songs / bringing light aboreal / silenced voice spoken
the man in my head / streams invective at the vile / twin in the mirror
tortured by sweet dreams / where we are still together / i miss my nightmares
it's not dusk, its dawn / all the life I've yet to live / shines white light on us
Writing haiku is — / There are not enough sylla- / Every line is too —
Desire in mind / Doing everything needed / Making it happen
Let me run / I don't need this anymore / Take a breath
The void.

Focus (with comic)
Winter’s conclusion / Seemingly around the corner / Till the warmth of spring
Faced with winter rains / drought scurries into hiding / but not forever.
Fly free little bird /only fools become content / death comes for us all
"Are you a coward?"/ In a moment of great strength/ I replied with "Yes."
The moment of truth / Arrives appropriately on cue / Patience a cruel must
Lying in bed, / I turn off my space heater / the sound of silence.
All these controllers / and you still had to play me / It's snowing on Mt. Fuji
the seconds ticking / all slipping through my fingers / like grasping purpose
My cigarette kissed the ground / Her eyes resisted meeting mine / Are you breaking up with me?
Powerful effort / Able to do anything / Passionately utilize
Bricks never complain / just squat on their brother's backs / no cigarette breaks
In February / I dream of cherry blossoms / while snow chills my face
You're like infection/You were killing me, but still.../so hard to remove
when i pull away / from the world into myself / i'm a ball of iron
Why not write it right? See inside for reply thanks. I hope you enjoy.
Shouts marking the time / Twelve out of twelve for effort / Better luck this year...
In this day and age / I find myself wondering / How much time is left
you don't give a fuck / and I can't complain / some bar defines you
grocery, heartbeat / dotted, bottom, and thin / staying in the lines
a rock for your roots / branches and leaves towards the sun / growing together
Waves crash onto shore / The beating beaches echo... / Traffic and glass, SMASH!
Right before your eyes / Lies the obvious answer / Now look toward it
My sexy story about free dating website
the wind in the trees / my hands softly through your hair / breathing so deeply

A good long nap does / wonders for unhappy minds which / fight to stay awake.
Snowy days in bed / Lost in a forest of sheets / I'm frozen in place
Please Remember / Intelligence is Worth Less / Than Enthusiasm
Seeking conclusion, / I captured a thousand words. / Why does it still hurt?
Karma, elusive./ boredom, oh so intrusive./ At least we are here.
Rocks skip on the pond / leaving small indentations / of our fleeting love
genitals of ho- / mosexual origin. / Oh, so this is rape.
cocaine transported / rectally. that's ten packs of / cigarettes, nigga.
Living in the past / It's the same as a slow death / Look forward and live
The more time I spend / at home, the more I look like / a homeless person.
It's mostly empty / vast black ocean of vacuum / except when it's not
The smell of mown grass / comes seeping in through windows / one more summer day
Sickness (with comic)
My best, oldest friend / You won't ever know my name / Sleep well you good boy
Since your happiness / requests that I be absent / mute, I acquiesce.
This Cat / Is A Magician / Makes Bubbles Appear
blues on my ceiling / cocaine couldn't ease the pain / be better off dead
Ah, to be a bird / Without a care in the world, /Flying tree to tree.

Smile in the Mirror
Silently sitting / With dawn comes my salvation / Patiently I wait
dusty bookstore/each tome/her beating heart
A Harrowing past/ But nostalgic memory/ Tempts a return.
It's too cold today / Out the window I see snow / I'm calling in sick
A bicycle waits/ For the ass which fills the seat/ of a sad sedan
To Doctor Massan / I wish to give many thanks / Soon I'm shooting blanks
this house is burning / aghast, I stand smoldering; / with no one to save
the ugly sweater / cranberry sauce drops blend in / why not some wine too
never moderate / i am the desperate measures / for desperate times
Mist surrounds the pines / The mountain echoes my thoughts / Stone steps lead to sky
Ashored
The sock into which/ I masturbate knows nothing/ Of the pain I feel
i know what you want / i could easily please you / why not piss you off?
alligator babies / sing a sad blues song that / only swamp queens can hear
Only eyes and teeth / Darkness shrouds the audience / Twinkling stars wait
There are no frontiers/ the future, far too distant/ memes are all I have
Nightmares (w/ comic)
You cannot kill time / it only changes and moves / like clouds out of reach
Small ring of stones lain / Over the place my heart rests / Take me with you love
You were real to me / You never lied to me / 'till you lied to me
Talking and talking / When will she ever shut up? / Guess it's not today
Silence comes with sleep / But then my dreams scream at me / Where for art thou, zen?
Moments of clarity - made by laughter between friends - crawls back beneath grief
Gray skies through window. / Icy winds bending tree tops. / Blankets warm my toes.
Traditions accrete / like a new planet's layers / Saturnalia
Mainstream Media / tells me when to be afraid / profiting from fear
I can touch your heart / and offer new perception / all you see is skin
How i hope for night. / How i hope for morning then. / Hope, it doesn't end.
Reciprocity / was all I ever wanted / Guess I’m not worthy
Never considered / Loss of love, a dampened heart / In bits and pieces
Trees? Streams? Rustling leaves? / These are all well and good, sure / But I prefer filth.
Bloody optician/ Left me blinder than a bat/ Rhyming in the dark.
Sushi is awesome / I write in japanese art / What a fucking weeb
With flesh between teeth / we'll tell children how the sea / used to sing with life.
I buttchug forties / may this haiku outlive me / and be fired through space
There is only now / accept it as perfection / presence is the key
I stare at the horse / The horse is staring at me / Sexual tension
blasphemies are just / vibrations in our windpipe / skies take no offense
Schizophrenia / Means never having to say / That you're sorry
A stone in the stream / Water rushing all around / It remains unmoved
I wish I was a / whale shark with little fish friends / to follow me around
Sighs internally / Loudly sighs externally / Sighs eternally
Animality / is no demotion; you were / never more than this.
flakes falling softly / like parachutes for slow rain / stark against the trees
Nothing is the same/Someone else is taking the/spots we used to fill
Unconventionality (with comic)
A wave crashes against the wall / droplets sprinkle the floor beyond / Goosebumps
Haiku
There's a man upstairs / Hiding in a dark closet / A knife in his hand
For ev'ry Mila / That exists in the world / There's also Rosie
when you're in the john / check your poop for miracles / cuz that's where they'd be
my daily haiku / a new google play store app / write, save, share your words
Friendship like a tree; / Pretty blossoms on a tree, / weak roots precede ruin.
I have no spirit, | no immortal soul; I am | what it is to be.
Let's dream each other / but never touch. We'll hold hands / there. But then forget.
Apathetic man/ He doesn't come around much/ A pathetic man
Shivers in the dark / A lovers kiss spells goodnight / Still, their warm embrace
Live in the moment / Live like there's no tomorrow /Die with no regrets

Gravity pulls us / Forces us to feel our weight / And yet we still stand
An empty chamber/ Bottomless like the abyss/ Feeling of regret
letting the dog out / was sure I saw a snowflake / here it comes agaim
reaching out the paw / a gentle touch on my face / "hey you, feed me now!"
the fireplace hearth / once adequately warmed up / is a kitty bed
for yellow tulips/it’s early to drop petals/but they drown in vase

Green tea with honey / The price is on the can though / I'm not paying more
This mat is a trap!/ Best laid plans of only men. / Such a sticky end.
eternity is/a sea, love is a shadow/death casts upon it
A tree's beauty now / makes it easy to forget / the seed grown in black
My bleary eyes strain / So many hours yet to go / Shows won't watch themselves
Want to eat that peach, on a beach, till there's no speech. Want to make you screech!
Job searching I hate. I'd rather forage the woods. Should have been born deer!
Some choice; bad or worse! / These are the best two we got? / We reap what we've sown.

We flattened the world / stood before the jagged edge / closed our eyes and jumped.
I hope he makes this/ He desperately needs this/ A sigh of relief
A heart is a room / Some are empty, others full / Mine is cold storage
fall night, darkness ‘bounds/what stark fright lies corners ‘round/let it not be clowns
Crisp brittle fall air/visible breath dissipates/wind invigorates
Man and son, fishers / From faint dusk to somber dusk / Sudden gloom, but why?
Downriver it floats / Tentacles searching for prey / An unseen monster

Ricochet, my mood,/ between heaven and hell's gate—/ yet do not pass on.
You try to haiku/although I'm better than you/surrender now thanks
Scared, scarred, / Yet another man has fallen; / The swift rain rattles
This is my haiku / If you don't like it, screw you / It obeys the rules.
unrequited love/friends for over thirty years/if he only knew
waking up alone / misty eyed yet full of life / the show must go on
Its impressive length/This nimble navigator/Has two hollow fangs
we walk hand in hand / the world unable to break / our unspoken bond
'Hold on or move on'/ I don't know; to exist as/ a quitter or fool

Crazy long day done / Commute from hell now over / Relax and just breathe”
To the voice which says/ don't bother, this won't be good/ thank you, now fuck off
My feet are too hot / So I'm working in my socks / Well, I say working...
Here I am, throwing/ myself off a wall, I caught/ in my game, a dream.
Dear moon, send my love / Mediate our sentiments / Your shine leads me home
A dying man dreams / that his friend will pick him up / sometime, tomorrow.
And so, I came home / to a sweltering summer / that smells like fireworks.
A signifier / only points to other signs / Everything adrift

Long shadows stretched / clouds, wind, and water flowed / from mountains tall
Chainsaw whining high / tree fibers snapping with strain / "monkey-beaver" life.
Earth is not breaking | We now have the tools to see | How broken it's been
lonely memories/and hearts without counterparts/ruins of love lost

Stripped from mother's arms / Born as Red as the eyes that / Weep over its grave
Regret buying cheap scotch / Tried to fix with club soda / failed even more

A heavy first touch / The taste of dirt and cool grass / Possession restored.
I smile less and go/out more to things with no cause/Semper Fi goodbye son
To pour gasoline/ on a country--a body/ dripping with sorrow

Come all you young hearts / Seek your fortune and lament / Fool's gold for the lot
If It fits, I sits / Where the warming sunbeam hits / It do fits! I sits

Pokemon Haiku
"Steak" I tell the man/ He scoops a pitiful spoon/ Give me more, darn it!
Each generation / fears it will see the world end. / It'd be an honor.

I, for one, will not / miss Brooklyn: they’ve made their own / choice to leave New York. #brexit
mosquito bit me / i see you little monster / blood stain on the wall
Warriors storm forth, / steadfast cherry blossoms fall– / the spring wind only shrugs.
Oh this summer heat / Unending, unforgiving / thunder storms abound
One day, you’ll either / scowl or smile at the mention / of my name. Which one?
"So what did you do today?" / "Ha, nothing, you know I have no friends" / I’d laugh if it was a joke
Bloated and swollen / Now unrecognisable / Death by committee
The fire of summer / Glowing like a lantern when / Captured in a jar.
Spring is upon us / New life, a new beginning / Its a time of change
Grassy base, snow top / Mountain trails open / Foot traffic scare deer
The rays of the sun / Distant call of the koveli / Night resides in me
Churning in silence / Burning with hateful violence / Yearning for guidance
Monday lacks something / I think it might be an "a" / Between "n" and "o"
This is what they do/ They always leave a note, huh? / 'til worlds meet again
Shaving, today I / noticed, two marks on my neck / now I'm a vampire?
Hello, are you there? / One missed call becomes several / haunting, Eerie ring.
It's all connected / memory, knowledge, and fate / tough pill to swallow.
We are the misfits / And our songs are much better / We are the misfits
Hundreds of spiders | Spinning silk webs on windows | Winter will come soon
Rich with writers block/ Words lost in maze of my mind/ Algernon save me
Onward to battle / A battle of emotions / The heart is weakest
Request: Haikus for the cards in a deck
Dark and stormy days / Temporary misery / The sun shines beyond
Floating in the pool / Naked under the night sky / Beauty all around
Never good enough / Emotional self-abuse / This is depression
I can't go to sleep, so I opened up tinder, you're cute want a poem?
Maybe it's okay | Not to plan for disaster | And enjoy right now
I live in a fire. Not good. Not bad. Just different. Flux is our constant.
As travelers pass cherry blossoms open near her smile

Good morning Gary, / Happy Lief Ericsson Day. / No, this is Patrick.
Good morning Gary, Happy Lief Ericsson Day. No, this is Patrick.
Haiku: 'what will you say in the last moment with the person you love?'
My truth like water / Flows through the cracks in your lies / Discovers its shape
What would happen if/ I deleted your number/ Well... nothing happened
How many toll booths/Does one have to throw change at/To have been somewhere?
AS SUMMER COMES / DARK HAIR OF AUTUMN GLORY / COLOR FADES TO WAN
That’s one thing about/People: they’re so messy once/You open them up.
ah shit man.... AGAIN/just hang on to that money/bargains are lifes gifts
One more year slips by / Like a well-aimed hockey puck / The goalie laments
木漏れ日に / 遠雷しかぬ / 真夏の日
"Nobody makes nice / manhole covers anymore," / I thought to myself.
Flash and machine whirr / Copy after copy prints / They are all the same
A breeze though the trees / Like leaves falling in autumn / Beautiful it is
Texas run sightings: Unidentified dead snake; two or three rabbits. #run
Inside of my head / Even friends abandon me / Anxiety sucks
Even a mirror / Will not reflect your true self / If you will not see
I can feel my thoughts...
The wind in your hair / Chilling bites upon your skin / The joys of winter
someone in my apartment building who stole my trousers from the communal laundry, I put a haiku up
Drinks again today / Can't find him the following / Found him, drinks again
days without sunshine / Are what we usually call / ‘nights’, as you might know
So thoughtful at night / whilst the boring sleep, he / marvels, he wonders
Dreaming i'm back home / Consciousness, please don't take me / I'm so happy here.
Stories of death / a new mass tragedy / closed my news app
I must leave you, drugs / Easy cash and hard pain dance / Death comes fast or slow
Constantly being / painfully reminded of those times / how it used to be
I am so so tired / I leaped off the ledge falling / from the sky near death
Minds work, yet hearts break / Distance grows, yet love withers / Cats melt the slick birds
One hard caliber / Six revolving chambers wait / My turn just came up
Hey ya'll look at me / hold my beer while I do this / funeral soon follows
The bombs fall softly / The earth rattles silently / The world dies slowly
Sending a collection of three resignation Haiku's to the office wide email. Would like to hear your thoughts
E-NFV is of incredible value. Brach of the future.
I. In the internment/ camp, notes passed, translated to/ five-seven-five: killed.
A leaden drop clings/Fire seethes for flesh to love/Ripples impending
Dark, distant rumblings / A gust of wind and on it / comes the smell of rain
Doors all around me/ on each wall won't open? Why?/ CAUSE THEY'RE REAL FAKE DOORS!
Behind a closed door / things happen, but I can't look / and neither can you.
Plummeting from sky / we observe as you ignite / meteor shower.
Into every life / the rain must fall, but in ours / it has reigned enough.
I have no desires / I am contented, but you / are permeation.
Into every life / rain must fall, but in this life / it just rains so much.
The journey began/ as seeking ended; the earth/ filled him with wonder
Middle of the week / worn, tired but still enthused / same as all weeks past
The benighted moth / and I, share a common fate / drawn towards your flame.
Webs woven wide Lies told and retold again Truth lost, the beast arises.
Shadow swirls, constricts / Gasping, flailing, straining, blind / praying for the light
Star Wars
There is no way out / I cannot escape the grasp / I love her too much
Briefly escaping / Brahman, two parabolas’ / asymptotic warmth
The bridge was breaking/ On both sides, he stood smiling/ for his wings grew back
Another cup now, / drink your 1000 moods in / handfuls of tea leaves.
He felt a fire rise/ From the deep void he couldn't close/ Explosion of joy
Another chance
from some dream afar/got that thing that's... just that thing/loves infinite grace
Jade-laden throne rooms, / adorned with scenes of splendor; / dynastic tombs rot.
The chipmunk the cat/ killed, family too--The monk/ who said "Bah, let's drink!"
Soup needs bread to dunk / Fingers crossed, check the bread bin / Only end slices
No one is watching, / two fingers and ten minutes, / and no one noticed.
you fly, I follow / lost in your tumbling embrace / the name of the wind
Haiku
This is where I rage / Dreaming of worlds trapped in flames/ Ashes coating your face
There it was / My sleep / Lying on mother's lap
Internet of rage./ Internet of glee. Funny/ meme, oh, please find me.
I am a cashier/ Not your bitch you piece of shit/ Unload your basket
Bacchus' loose conduct/ Mercury's chicanery/ And Mars' hot temper
I'm begging for love / Not knowing what it is like / Suffering alone
tempest her rhythm/ echoes of a dark song/ a story in silence
My motivation, / Is out there somewhere, waiting. / Why can’t I find you?
The heart without love, like a garden without life, will never know joy.
5 dogs break silence/ 5 dogs bark "Wake up," "Walk me,"/ 5 dogs burn my brain
I prefer hamsters/ They bite when they don't want you/ And run in circles
Scorpion waits still/ Cricket jumps and triggers hairs/ Barb gives life and death

I died last July / Ice cream melting on my corpse / Best summer ever
sometimes, when i see/my shadow, i think about/how evil i am
Untitled.
sometimes, when i see/my shadow, i think about/how evil i am
hope
My Love
sigh
Some good, lots are bad,/ these decisions I have made./ But all pivotal
Mother unfurled steam/ She saw men fornicating/ Her son curled in tears.
Hug when I'm weeping/Or the monsters are creeping./Or just to sleep in
Elements are seen / Even ones made-up, in sets / Like Romeo and...
Time, stop this motion. / If I can't have perfection, / give me stagnation.
Your heart is a bird / all the world is a cage / only love will open
When I was deadwood / The wave came over me so fierce / Now, I am driftwood
A nice long weekend: Four days out of the office; huge tasks due Tuesday
**#"{DULur}"&+:>WaTcH['Star Wars: The Force Awakens'].Full.. Movie.. pUTlocker . HD...#**
We couldn't fill it?/ There's less than I remember./Guess it's better that way.
Three small puncture wounds / A howl to curdle the blood / That's where the plug is.
You adorn yourself / With divinity and I shall / Call myself pious
Months it has taken. / Peace, at last, we have found it; / pushing up daisies.
Her tears fell on the / third rail and shut down New York, / it wasn't her fault.
POEMS AND HAIKUS!!!!!!!
all the more stupid/the tale of the butterfly/who clipped her own wings
Rocks underwater / can't hide because they still make / waves on the surface.
Now dreams elude me / From the comfort of my bed / Oh sleep, where art thou
The harsh wind whispers. / It's vehemence muffled. / Your heart out of reach.
I am forgiven/
On the cusp again/Crossroads of life approaching/Which path will I choose?
Mind's Direction
"Where did you go, love?" / I asked ten bottles. Silence. / I'll just ask ten more.
guess it's times like these/she's more than a pretty face/the repetition
Through the syntax I see / Operations that vex me / Let's start refactoring thee
A smoker coughing / The cricket chirping outside / As a chair reclines
life:pause,rewind,play/cassette tape worn thin, then torn/It's over, then tears
Programming falters / Memories come flooding back / He lowers his gun
an ocean apart / two crazy girls fall in love / it was real, I know
Does uncertainty / devour all at age thirty / or am I unique?
waxing and waning / a heart rising and falling / my moon has vanished
The sand on the beach / Churned-up by small children's feet / sand castle dreaming
Our house has fallen | Torched through persistent neglect | Everything ashen
sleepless nights pile up / in a mass of seething stress / watch my carcass twitch
Moving out the house/ Paying taxes, buying milk/ A mother in tears.
Not drinking too much/ That or drinking too little/ Don't tell my doctor
575 Do not speak your wish/ Before the shimmering snow/ Space-rock, Hadouken!
A familiar road / one that used to take me home / Highway 43.
If I could see you/ Half awake and almost dead/ I'd cherish the zed
(what are emotions?) / i feel like i'm a robot / slowly breaking down
[3/3/5] evening sun / paints spring's leaves / in autumn's echo
Prancing in the rain. / We splash in puddles, laughing. / You are my best friend.
You seek empathy / for your infidelity / Literally Hitler
I came into the world / knowing I'd be gone in a / breath and still I danced.
I came into the world/ knowing I'd be gone in a/ breath and still I danced.
There's still part of me / maybe, just the empathy / somewhere in that sea.
What chance did we have? / When yours is a heart of fire / and mine, ashen stone.
players gonna play / ignored sound advice from friends / burned will not forget
The saddest haiku: / when you think it’s your best but / alas, just 1 upvote
Nothing's happening / The spinning thing keeps spinning / Ctrl, Alt, Delete
springtime is quite nice / very calm and very cool / sun's out there's flowers
This is a haiku / I love to make them a lot / They are very fun.
players gonna play / ignored sound advice from friends / got burned won't forget
apple blossoms bloom / to what may I compare you / lovely spring fragrance
The rain continues / Pitter patter on the grass / Baseball is delayed
Like the moon over / the day, my genius and brawn / are lost on these fools.
Friends with benefits/ Eating the last known bison/ Insatiable bloodlust
Blanket/Orpheus/Human bodies/Paper petals/Furrowed/One brow.
Ripples in the pond / The blue heron strikes quickly / Golden orfe scatter
spiraling vortex, / floating through the universe. / sink drains, enthralling.
Spring is here: Warm rain, / dark clouds, puddles, wet clothing. / My bed is cozy.
Though you’re just a drop / in the sea of faces, to me / you are an ocean
You’ve stumbled and fell / Worry not, child, that’s learning; / You’re leaning to run
lonelines at work / is a constant reminder / of my life at school
Exploring this world; / not all who wander are lost. / Nice to meet you too.
Bitter winds echo/ With the moonless night lit bright./ I, indelible.
You are a Native. / Natives are good for nothing. / I will enslave you.
You've been amazing. / From the beginning, in fact. / But then you forgot.
Laying in my bed/ Mexican music is loud/ Will it ever stop
The grey curtains fall / Still drunk on dry summer days / Pleasant petrichor
amidst probing eyes / she flaunts the skin; her face, a mask / bills like fallen leaves
Solving a puzzle / only to find, in the end / A piece was missing
Look up and away / No-where to go but uphill / Dread the future's trek
Look up and away | No-where to go but uphill / Dreading future's trek
Is there ever a / discussion about haiku / format conventions?
Walked barefoot outside/ Not paying much attention/ I stepped on a snail...
Scars are just the signs / Of the past failures through which / You have persevered
shaking like a leaf/falling backwards like thunder/reversed and rehearsed
Kept awake by angst/ I want to smash your brain stem/ With a railroad spike
My heart, sure it breaks / and yea, my hands, they might shake / O, time's cruel slaughter.
You weren't a 'burr' / you were a young sprout, guided / to a better place.
He's alone in this / Couples talking as they pay / Maybe tomorrow
upstairs they make love / creaking bed keeps sleep at bay / perhaps a porno
Prematurely bald / relinquish last of beauty / savings on shampoo
first match on Tinder / one polite message to her / "soz meant to swipe left"
Florida Summer
A dusty wardrobe / full of worn out boots and coats / and dead ambitions.
nigh apocalypse/ good thing I saved the baby / that's some good eatin'
a seedy motel / the wall bends with the banging / the beast with two backs
don't give in, push on / raise banner high, cry "BATTLE!" / who do i fight for?
The wind speaks to me/At night it seems to whisper/I love you the most
touch, taste, connection / my lovers eyes, wide and green / in her universe
when I cry at work / the other clowns take notice / and grin nervously
And on the third day/God said: "Let there be light"/Lamps were made, God left
arms, legs, rays of light / complete illumination / she walks, my mind clears
Sitting, pondering: / socks are unnecessary. / profound? I hope not.
reach deep down inside / produce one gory organ / to skid in the pan
My hearing faded/ I learned it didn't matter/ no one talked to me
This beauty warms me; / bathing in the radiance. / Salutations, Sun.
my heart skips a beat / a mouse rattling the (rib) cage / begging for release
My nose is tingling / I sense a change in the air / Fuck, it's allergies
A grand tree plummets / cacophonous crash ensues / Yes, I hear a sound
even if you won / when the fighting is over / you must still submit
she dreams like water / trapped in her container / with infinite reach
I dig and you dig, / He digs, she digs, they dig— damn / What a deep haiku
Hi boo haiku
Eyes and hands survey your body, a book. I am author, audience.
The world
never boil a rock/ it could have an air pocket/ that makes it explode
I'm in a good mood / Tappin' my feet to a song / Hummin' in my mind
Titled: Girlfriends
Curiosity: / Did it really kill the cat? / It has eight more lives.
It hurt too cruelly: / It’s water under the bridge / Yet I still feel it
Audacious Hope my / callipygian consort / lost I'm without you
Over oceans vast Let the wind carry my voice And with it my mind and self
Things collecting dust / Are the only stuff I've got / In this prison called "now"
I'm looking for a lot of haiku by various authors for a project.
there is no such thing / as a soft taco only / a shit burrito
A soft little child/ Fought a wolf in wintry lands/ Came back as their king.
Interrupted Journey
Sap: tree's blood; sticky / Sadness belongs to people / People feel feelings
Snow reveals the grass / as trees are changing to green / My heart is still cold.
I cheated on her / in the summer of our youth. / We've reunited :) :) :)
More fish in the sea? / "Such a shame. She was your sea" / my mind says to me.
Why you saps so sad? / Write about something happy / trampolines, Perhaps.
Dear sweet, fleeting, love / perhaps we could meet again / in another time.
Drunk on rotten fruit / Stag stumbles through the mountains / and meets some pink Hens
Not fond of living / But it's not worth quitting / Some day I will die
よく見れば・花があります・うつくしい
Die for your country / Die for kin. Die killing men. / An honourable sin.
Languid summer days / in lazy garden shadows / relax and dissolve
Oh, to be the wind / Who, alone, holds the pleasure / Of tussling your hair
passing fancy
For hours I scroll / Youtube, Reddit, and Facebook / what a waste of time
Letting Go of Harshness
Melting snow on roof / Is my soul as white as you -- / Or street slush to sluice?
Melting snow on roof / Is my soul as white as you / Or street slush to sluice
The heat is heavy/ on my shoulders, my problems/push me to the ground
A rumbling hunger; / aching to feast on bounty. / Oh, no, flatulence.
My head is pounding / Dark thoughts chase away the light / The black dog is here
My beautiful cat / Please stop your incessant meows. / It's barely past dawn.
Bark, bark bark bark bark / Bark bark meow; meow meow bark bark / Meow bark meow: meowbark
Bark, bark bark bark bark / Bark bark meow; meow meow bark bark / Meow bark beow: meowbark
Sunshine and the beach / Sand, sea and children's laughter / Summer just a dream
Haiku and running / Clutter, cleanse mind and body /Breathless syllables
a lid lifts slowly / revealing the glowing eyes / of a vampire
Life is so fleeting / Like a daffodil in spring / Radiant then gone
Girl walks on sad street/A hooker with angels feet/Needs a man to meet Looking for a date?/Itchy skin and twitchy grin/He invites her in An hour later/His clothes are gone, hes paid her/Now sore she lays there Girl sleeps in sad bed/Demons drift through angels head/Looks alive, feels dead
Forum to forum / The internet fishing troll / It's time to fight back
From forum to forum / The internet fishing time troll / to counter the troll
Don't be paranoid / but please keep an eye out for / unattended bags
Fire in the brush/ Rabbit gets a promotion/ Are you hungry yet?

if you knew the truth / and what happens around you / you'd be scared shitless
Hemp and beads laid out / Inspiration in the air / Knotting underway
Pitter-patter boom / Lights flickering in my room / Thunder, lightning, doom
there were countless nights / of being with, to now be / suddenly without
You know Mister Owl / From the Tootsie Roll Ads? He's / Above my fireplace
Outcomes uncertain / I manifest perfection / This moment is mine
once I soiled my pants / skiing down beginner's slope / still I am humble
Though you’re just a drop / In the sea of faces, to me / You are an ocean
When I was little/ I used to think I could fly/ Reality hit
fear's a reminder / of how far acceptance is / from understanding
Laughter, giggles, smiles; / children playing soothes my soul. / Yet, a child I am.
All my problems stem / From being raised by 4chan / Fascist porn age Nine
melancholy mood/ jazz wafting through subway air/ I dance with myself
Welcome to Monday / "living" for another week. / rinse, lather, repeat.
Waking up slowly / I sleep until the dog barks / Then I write Haiku
Good Mexican Food / My farts are filling the air / Chile Rellenos
kissed by sunlight/ your smile makes me happy/ as the sun sets.
Shining wind, ah— / The gaze of the sun / Greets us anew.
Shining wind -ah-,/ The gaze of the sun/ greets us anew.
(3/5/3) - bright sunshine / bees bumble among / dogwood blooms
Crystallization / A platinum straw goddess / Hollow ecstacy
the wind does my hair / it does a pretty shit job / but it's free of charge
Crystallization
i remain hollow / you visit me in my dreams / and leave me empty
there is no room for / ulcerative colitis / yet it fits line two
Doctor's waiting room/empty now except for me/two hours, still waiting
A dimly lit room / the weary crowd issues groans / while Zack Snyder dines
Before internet / the right-wing cranks were hidden: / I can see them now
Before internet/the right-wing cranks were hidden/I can see them now
a pristine toilet / a man's reluctant bowels / a stray pube mocking
Black, strong and bitter/Anticipating the rush/that may hit too hard.
I wonder how many times computer techs have found mother loads of porn on a customers computer.
A sun without heat / a wave without the ocean / I am no different
Staring back at me / No hint of recognition / All fish are stupid
In out in out in / out in out in out tick tock / tick tock..."It's a boy!"
Moon shows the wolf's dance/ it's muzzle towards the sky/ Howls the ancient trance
Summer is coming: / Longer days and late sunsets. / Fun every weekend.
I resented you/ I blinked, and you slipped away/ I miss you so much
eternal toad lives / to forever and beyond / afterward, he croaks
A tree stump, a seat/ A place to rest tired feet. / Gift from Mother Oak.
In biology, / We did eye dissection. It / Was eye opening
The sly hummingbird / Teasing as it darts about / Ever out of reach
Hilarious joke! / A chicken crosses a road. / Got hit by a truck.
Wasted away life. / Sitting at a computer. / Shame to say it's me.
Haiku for Donald
Meandering by, / we watch the lazy river. / We wasted it: time.
Available tools: / Finding a good use for them / difficult can be.
Kangaroos are fat /who are they stompin around/ like they own the place?
Fridays wanning / weekends ever fading freedom / Monday already?
No more dislodged tiles / replaced with linoleum / things are looking up
White, blue, deep scarlet / I see the red grow, flooding / Drowning our eagle
Like an icicle / slowly melting inside me / I shiver in bed
God damn you, woman / my broke heart is full of you / and I can't fix it.
Fuck you, I hate you. / My heart is confused and hurt / Let me be at peace.
Jack shone bloody light / On White Chapel’s misery / Autumn of Terror
Life's just long enough / To chase your passion and dreams. / Forever, or else.
She made an excuse / and flew from her gilded cage. / My secret lover.
Staring and staring/ my pen frozen mid-sentence/ Eyes open mind closed
A few days ago / I tried to remember it / Instead I forgot
Cackling, giggling, mad / Our post copulating ritual / Our perfect temperature
Slight wind blowing in / Brighter starlight beyond clouds / More enjoyable
Rounded ageless ones / tumescent under the glass / broken by pinpoints
The moon light falls in / reflecting on the snowbanks / buds sleep in silver
A broken mirror / Depicting my inner self / Cracked yet functional
Limited beauty / Art forever restrained by / A handful of words
I am what I am / I am no more, yet no less / I am what I am
Beautiful stranger / imagination takes hold / known you forever
Worn path by the street / tattered shoes, shuffling feet. / Can you spare some change?
The meaning of life / I always knew what it was / Sadly I lost her
Worn path by the street / shuffling feet, tattered shoes / Can you spare some change?
Silence--loyal friend// the answers are held within // listen to it's voice...
Haiku reposted / It was an honest mistake / Duplicate is down
Michigan springtime / Confused robins listening / For worms under snow
Old man winter flees/He leaves behind sadness, fear/Where will we end up?
Spring. Showers; sideways / A Doe shelters in my yard / from the cold, North wind.
Dead but still breathing / There's no cure for inner cold / A breathing tombstone
She's married to him / but her heart belongs to me. / It's complicated.
I should really stop / writing hai...ku...? Ah, dang it... / I did it again...
How is it that I / can heal the wounds of others / but never my own?
Go forth, wayward son / You will find peace in the end / Don't you cry no more
I would not be on / My best behavior with you / In movie darkness
Did you find the light? / Yes i've found the light. / But i'm losing sight
Yin and Yang wiper / Sun’s rays warming cold windows / Bounding white-flagged deer
My desires take flight / because I don't understand / how much they can hurt.

Psilotum nudum, / Banana cream allusion, / Cretan brake, cycad.
Tears roll down my skin / let yourself fall into me / the tears are not mine
Magnolia sweet / grey fingers hold the blossom / spring blows towards me
Dad found out I'm gay / He then called me a faggot / I called him a cunt
Ginkgo leaves unroll / their fans playing in the wind / who is pushing whom?
Forcythias glow / golden reflections escape / where the shadows fall
April showers bring / May flowers make the birds sing / "Welcome, welcome spring"
Tangled in the sheets / Fingers sticky with desire / I can taste your love
I would not be on / My best behavior with you / In movie darkness
Sing me to sleep. No / matter how off key you are, / your voice still soothes me.
That’s 5 syllables / And that’s 7 syllables / Haikus aren’t hard
A dot in the sky / a titan of flaming rage / what am i to them?
I will wait for you / Be it a thousand summers / or, for forever.
We could have helped you/ but you're good at tying knots/ I think of you still
My first haiku
Two ascending birds/ Drop from their height to the dew/ In an earthy thud.
Filling up with hope; / the chrysalis protects my dreams. / Oh flames, be gentle.
I'm falling / And I'm terrified / I should hide
I love you / And not even fear / Will change that
A church bell chimes twice-/My eyes close as the sound fades/And I dream of you.
After a few beers/ I'm a bit free and hazy/ I fear tomorrow
no one in this sub / thought to drop a line, or two / dreams are coming true
They say they will die for you / But I live for you / Every-single day
The only time I've / Ever said I love you was / In a text message
I am new to this / Please up vote me, I'm desperate / Thank you OK Bye
This is a haiku / This has seven syllables/ Self-Explanation
Limited only / By our imaginations / And phone batteries
Crawling in my Skin/These wounds they will not he-al/Fear is how I Fall.
Of water: Negative half glass/Yesterday it was, today/self contemplating
if air and water / is fluid, does a seaplane / ever really land?
Breath becomes shallow / And I flicker on and off / For I am the breath
Fucking Teacup pigs // I see them and make a noise // Not manly at all
The smile fades, eyes cry / Love is lost, not forgotten / Forever long passed
iridescence of / my reflection, impression / talks to me in tears
how could this happen / my heart lies broken again / why won't you have me
Grow, stand, protect, feed; // watchers of humanity. // The mighty tree falls.
Happiness for sale, / if you can find it. / Collection only
A fine yellow dust / the source of my misery / Spring’s not always fun
A classmate's passing / remembrance of long ago / death came too soon
Rain on Saturday / Drips of melancholia / Fucks up my weekend
Rain on Saturday / Drips of melancholia / Fucks up my weekend
Please just let me go / I am tired of being trapped / Bed you're so comfy
When fear arises / Tranquility’s clarity / And vision distort
a tiny satellite / caught in your orbit briefly / two misaligned paths
Your eyes open and / close rapidly heart beat mind / wanders missing you
Simple bets for fun/oh, how my chest boast outwards/it's mine, victory
missing you today / I wonder if you'll read this / do you think of me?
At night after work / surrounded by mosquitoes / taking down damp clothes.
Sadness consumes me / Hello, darkness, my old friend / I drink my feelings
The low yellow moon / Peaking through the trees, peeking / Like the eye of God
Make booze not bullets, / use more drugs not more drone strikes, / but please do not vape.
When life shuts a door, / Just open it. It’s a door. / That is how doors work.
Refrigerators / Refrigerators are cool / Refrigerators
I have headset mics / we spend tonight acting out / TEDtalk fantasies
You torture me, dear/With your love in small doses/A twist of the knife

Inexplicable/How I can be contented/Yet want so much more
Alone in the dark. / Above sheets under the fan. / A plane's fading growl.
Old, used teddy bear, / He waits for tea time to play. / Tea time never comes.
Sirens wail; steel hail / Mankind's last great fireworks show / Ground shakes, shock hits - peace
Piss Flaps Slapping Sound/Girlfriend Walks Around The Room/Put Some Clothes On Bitch
No wound fully heals / ripping off a band-aid / still leaves a residue
Forget all your fears / and remember to be great / and you will succeed
i'm not at the top / to be keeping your spot warm / i belong up here

Chopsticks collect dust / Chins double and guts bubble / Ways of the burger
The solution, YES! / I have figured it all out! / The napkin flew off...
Dystopian fun/ A response to our future/ romanticized strife
slow exhale as her/wordless communication/she stares onward
The jingle jangle / of a homeless man's bucket / I step to the beat.
We've only one life/and yet, there's so much beauty/but with just one life...
very happy cat / a sleeping weight in my lap / I think she loves me

My Favorite, And In My Opinion, Most Powerful Haiku I've read. Hokku by Fukuda Chiyo Ni (1703-75)
You have made me cry/I travelled from far away/My wife is not here
Fallen redwood now / Lies across the beaten path; / Eons passed it by.
Cock gobbler Nob head/Sticks and Stones go fuck yourself/Eat shit and die, cunt.
Frost on the window / And winter is on its way / Need more insulation
Leave it all behind / One door shuts, one more opens / A revolving door
Paris feels depressed / so she peers around corners / that's how Paris copes
I accidentally started a haiku fest in /r/australia (link inside)
Fallout 4 is here / I have no next gen console / I feel so [crippled]
It's fall / There are leaves in the alley / Deal with it
Green iced birthday cake / Topped with little dinosaurs / Both things now extinct
My sticky lover / Juices running down my chin / Oh golden mango.
There once was a man/ his name would bring trumpet sounds/ he's named John Cena
There once was a man/ his name would bring trumpet sounds/ his name is John Cena
Subjectivity. / Is anything here objective? / Subjectivity.
Autumn afternoon / Commune with the Woods Goddess / Leaves crunch underfoot
Shiver and shudder / The small leaf clings for dear life / Sunbeams forgotten
Solders of the land/ I ask you to fight the rats/ Fascists die tonight/
Left with a lone slice / colors drawn in my pallete / triangular art
I could remember / that faint light from red sunsets; / Guidance once, now dim.
Fly By Night, Only/Two kinds of life soar in ways/Take time to look up.
I wrote in China / a collection of Haiku / I hope you enjoy
iPhone Nineteen Plus / It teleports you through spacetime / Get ready. Get one. Now.
Young, sick and dying / The man on the throne smiles / Lucky, I wake up
Teeth slowly sink in / Juice dribbles down, down her chin / Smiles a wolfish grin
And I spoke to her She alone is my reason I survive for her
Century-old film / Just as I remember it / the hill to Bray's Head.
a warm cup of tea/ soft hum of morning rain drops/ two dimples appear
I have a penis / I choke and beat him sometimes / He still loves me so
What is its nature?/Unhewn, Unfettered, Open/here the rock remains
I'm not creative / Except for little haikus / Thank Bobby Shaftoe
On Halloween night / The pumpkin becomes a star / Dressed in its disguise
With so much to do, / It's a wonder how I've yet / Not gotten so spent.
Reconnecting... 10 / Reconnecting... 11 / Reconnecting... 12
She is within reach / She faded out of my reach / Still, I am reaching
Terrible Person / How the light defeated you / Happy is the cure

Seasonal Haiku
Cold skies turn leaves red/ Summer’s memory fading/ Settle in, to dark Sun’s push for six hours/ Effortless, the moon’s eighteen/ Thin, sharp, crystal air.
Autumn swift like fire / flares bright summer’s once green leaves / and bares dark branches
ふゆばれかきたふきませんさゆるです
The bottle neck I grasp / Your hand it had once embraced / Pain gone till morning
Suddenly, a bolt / hammers, ground drops from beneath / and darkness swallows
Which way should we go? / Are we lost? Does it matter? / Backpackers struggle.
Stay before you leave / Heat on the runway rises / Cold wind encroaches
You're no longer you. / It just feel like I'm talking / To the disorder.
On the street walking/I see you and look away/It seems I'm too cool
Look! A shooting star./No, only a satellite/burning through the sky.
My ex machina/What is the reason of life?/I await your voice
paste and glue can help/ but nothing will truly mend/ my heart and my head
baby gets older/ distance grows ever wider/ I'm sorry I left
Sometimes the unknown // Is much worse than what we know // Don't regret your truth
Nights are difficult /mother cries until morning/ I wish I could help
Dead rat on my porch / tumors upon its small head / mother says they're ticks :(
want to dream bigger/ yet I have sleep to conquer/ lonely Sunday nights
a cold winter night/ she hurls herself into a lake / her clothes set ablaze
Haze in spinning head/for spilt coffee and burnt bread / morning sickness bites
Work, play, fight no more/I've given you my all and/My chest is empty.
winter ticks on slow/ but the songbird does not count/ each cold morning note
Rivals at red lights/a glimpse at another life/Yellow, green, goodbye.
Sitting in the rain / Beer, cig and mind full of pain / I must move again
I am always late / it is time to leave you see / but here I still wait
1. All my thoughts today / Are worries for the future / This is not living.
grey mist, low laying / slowly drowns autumns vibrance / sun, are you no more?
Catastrophising / Anxious thoughts racing so fast / Doom is forshadowed
All I felt was love/ I had forgotten the truth/ I'm alone; abused.
Life's anxiety / makes me flee from everything. / Sadness has become.
Happiness will come / if only you stay, remain./ The time is not now.
Oh pestilent rat/ your corpse a morbid trophy/ now plague me no more
One bottle empty / The limoncello is gone / I open the schnapps.
When you love someone / make certain that they know or / you may stay alone.
He struck its head. Split! / The child has killed the monster. / Not really. It lives.
He struck his head, Split! / The child killed the monster. / Not really. It lives.
A time machine / an ignorant family / metamorphosis
Leaves in a river / Victims of the restless tide, / Dancing in small hope

"Heed me not!/I am false and wronged"/Truth is told
Through turbulent seas / Veiled of viral disease / thank you Columbus

Plasticine, smooth grey/case controlling copper guts/pulsing with cool light
Blonde, surgeon, petite / Destructively eloquent / With her scalpel tongue
Boys, bats, balls, and gloves / There's gonna be a ball game / But where, when, and why?
Thoughts enter my head,/move about then disappear,/leave nothing behind.
Michael McClure inspired haiku
I didn't hear you/ Underneath my greater days/ You were always there
thunderous roar from / above grey cloud shrouded sky / scales showering down
My tired mind strays/ Again searching for your face/ I hope it stays lost
Defiantly free / eyes wide-shut, head buried deep / chained in all but mind
Dull aching nothing / eroding all importance / life unexamined
Woods are welcoming; / dark, mysterious. In light, / work days teem with wolves.
Four fingers brandy / Two Advil, boiling water / French cure for a cold.
Dry, scratchy throat / Headache and a stuffy nose / Help me, hot whiskey.
September morning / A young swallow flees its nest / Behind it, winter.
September morning / A young swallow leaves its nest / Behind it, winter.
Those mushrooms you ate / Were hallucinogenic / April Fools, grandpa
morning / through an open window / the sun's shadow
Goodnight yesterday / Goodnight darkness / I will see you in the morning
Two youg men throw / "Caution" signs into a pile / and light them on fire.
Surrounded by people / no space to even turn / and yet all alone
coalesced chaos / in a thought, then another / remember to breathe
Illustration of "Autumn Moonlight" by Matsuo Basho

Another sleepless / Night in my not-so shiny / Armoire; it is locked.

Mornings without You

Annoying Produce
Keep me awake / and I'll return the favour, babe. / Kisses for kisses.
My greatest regret / is not calling my auntie / just before she died.
A warm Sunday night. / Trash cans topple, bored children / peddle home to bed.
When it's rough be tough
World gone mad burns hot/ change haunts the unwilling/ truth is subjective
The sky black and blue / Atmosphere forever bruised / No need of healing.
Three abreast we weep / Cold stone marks brightness made dark / Body and soul rest.
It takes an ocean / and a moon, just to erase / footprints in the sand.
Don't bark at children. / Cut the shit, you cunty bitch. / I'll duct-tape your snout.
Stop barking at kids. / Shut up, you cunty bitch. / I'll duct-tape your snout.
Shoeless wanderer. / She speaks of the dead people / who ride her shoulders.
Surrounded, I'm trapped / this should'nt be ending now / I have failed you.
After a long hike/I sit down to contemplate/ the conforming dirt
Our love burns alight. / But we fight in the shadows. / Flickering. Shifting.
A soul made of flames / My world is cold without you / Bring back the summer
go find some acid / code while tripping real nicely /hope for the best man
Do you feel at home / A permanent occupant / Of my mind and heart
Cop cars on his tail,/ at last he checked the fuel gauge/ on the stolen truck.
California heat / A loveless desert wasteland / Still I miss your warmth
Timid ambition //to act using discretion //as yet, still unknown
Moving on.
Even ancients wither / the sun gazes in fusion / radiation bath
Streams of icy tears / Death has helped their master here / Guilty conscience clear
You were getting dressed/You told me that you loved me/Woke up from a dream
I love holding you/I don't want to wake you up/so my face will itch
Withered ancients creak / As gusts billow asunder / Toppling the meak.
Can't shake these feelings / Rough stubble; deep, long kisses / My face still tingles
We see an eagle / the sly fox's distraction / from the wolf among us
Head on the window, / the only conversation / is pattering rain
You aren't worthy of / the crown of love that remains / steadfast on your head
Warm waves course through me / Amazing experiences / Just had my first kiss
A smashed wedding cake / slides down the windshield of her / ex-mother-in-law
First try!
Electronically / Illuminated spectres / Rearview, looking down
My mask must be worn / to hide the demons I bear / from those I love earnst

"The MCAT"- A tribute to the struggle
My autocorrect / just changed the word forever / to the word forget.
You've changed a lot dude
Vocabulary / Why not use a shorter name / Like word library
When the tears have been dried/And the cold, numb lack recedes/You must move onward
pigeons sit atop / an abandoned gas station / an avian pit stop
Deja vu my love/where have you been all these years!/cold night reflection
The end of the road / No direction to go to / Might as well go back.
Little blond boy squats / Examining an ant hill / His bike sits, waiting
A turkey vulture / Occupied picking over / A raccoon carcass

Haiku of a College Student
The house always wins/cut my losses and go home/don't you dare look back
Disconnect
hollow bamboo stick / drip by drip, filling it up / tilt, drain all at once
Shame comes flooding in/ So many words washed away/ Happiness can't float
nothing much to say/ even when things are okay/ nothing much to say

Fluorescent Jungle/Burning in my cranium/Fresh air awaits me

Compartmentalized/Office work is for the birds/Can I be a fish?
I am like a cave / Empty and hollow and dark / Filled by your echo
Immutable ore / Obelisk of Gaia's make / Stretches to the sun
"vote up if" I dared / does that violate the law? / only mods will tell
I keep a splinter / Deep in the palm of my hand / Will it ever want me?
you probably shouldn't / I am a mess and a half / #unseen confession
single sight of you/and I am knocked down, laid out/why misplace my love?
Sweat, aches, pain and tears / Sexy body, here I come / Gotta keep pushing
I fear we're too young / to have fallen this deep, but / pull me deeper still
I am Anakin / So much anger from within / I am Darth Vader
cut me from your heart/now I will cut you from mine/our love suicide
My body tenses / in shock. Drilling into my / core. Eyes Wide Open
The "me" before "us" / Now a distant memory / But I don't miss her
I loved you so much/I became self destructive/My broken heart weeps
Clear half moon / is there any guarding / this gate? 🌓
From Planet Autism / Occupy Humanoid frame / Found in buried box
A haiku for every man I ever slept with.
見られない / 鏡花水月 / 触れない
Restless sleep at night / Lying next to midnights heart / Thoughts of gold til dawn.
A slice of darkness/ Sprinkled with despair, cries out/ The worm at the core
I consume too much/ I am angry about it/ yet I consume more.
Drugs will get you high/What does love do for a man?/And is it enough?
Money has value / You give it all of your time / Which one is worth more?
Half-living, half-dead,/The necromantic curse of/Working the night shift.
night gives no solace/darkness augments the distance/sleep's rare without you
Its a painful thing / To see loves live without you / Indifference hurts worse.
Night's serene darkness, / the soft murmur of water / pacify my soul.
sand in my bell / it still shakes / with the ocean
Caught in a downpour / The alligator puddles / I watch where I step
I sleep, the car shakes/it dances on the cliff side/the Pacific winds
I am headed down/a path of self deatruction/petite suicide
I just can't go on/thinking about you and I/I unfriended you
croaking black ravens/sun beats like a steel hammer /waiting for the rain
The dogs run barking / A rabbit in the garden / At the tomatoes
lives that once rejoiced / beneath the very spaces / we now occupy
one day stars align / but you already forgot / how to deal with fate.
My head moves to/ The rocking of the train:/ Sinking into sleep
I would never trade/my choices for five more years/my life is my life
A mirror moves by / eyes swimming in its glory / for it reflects the light
Manic behavior/it's so irresponsible/it beats depression
Solo not alone/lonely not solitary/Never holding hands again
Lone Pokémon card / Abandoned at the bus stop / No-one chooses you
Flames, bright and dancing / eventually become / ashes scattered, dying
Cutting through the air / Silently, like a dagger; / Butterfly in Fall.
Coal becomes closer / Turns into diamonds. Much like / Friends become couples.
hoping to forget/ fearless in an endless void/please let me go now
Glorious yet short, / Some times simple, others puzzling, / Life, or a haiku.
My stubborn beliefs/Broken in the summer night/You didn't come back
"Look, a falling star, / make a wish". Little does she know / Mine has come true already.
my heart, iron cast / presuming a clean farewell / molten once again
a fantastic bird / dancing under blue moonlight / too heavy to fly
my first haiku
Coiled predator / leaps on prey with claws oustretched / and grips ball of string
Small cafe milk jug / makes devastating spillage / Tea time in chaos
Small cafe milk jug / makes devastating spillage / Tea time in chaos
The seat is chosen / your years are spent, no matter / Every thread, woven
My Unicycle
A new day beckons / Obliteration present / Can't stop the train now
I eat and I cry / Masticate and lacrimate / I just don't know why
What did the clam say \\ at his nephew's bar mitzvah? \\ Mollusktov Shellhome!
seismic self anguish / to them it's smiles and laughter / covert suffering
Ignorant bliss when / bothering everybody / such as rainy clouds
Recreational / overexaggeration / desensitizes.
Lyle Stevik hung/killed himself but who is he?/checked in to check out
天の川/天上天下/放浪者
Disarm the mother/Seeds exiled to barren soil/Birth into never
When it comes to life / Bliss is found but in one place / Inside of yourself
Wind like soft fingers / Clasps rock faces close, and then / Losing hold, floats on
Yearning for a love / I may not be ready for / Pure, true confusion
my hand cradles your own/breathless adoration enduring/yearning/for renewal
Ascents and slopes / on the rollercoaster of life / Sit back and enjoy
I love her kind eyes/ That one kind that dares to love/ The ones that love me
A body not mine/you numbed out little fuck toy/you like that don't you?
Her touch, soft caress/My face warm, my spine goes cold/Is it love I feel?
Auburn Sky, Autumn/Drifting emptily forward/A leaf, or a man?
Do not deflate for / what you put at stake. / Better late than extirpate.
Plateau in the sun/Rounded peak destroying clouds/No love in shadows
Midnight sky conjures/Shapeless constellations and/I see tomorrow
In the desert eye/Forms a mirage, oasis/And the sky rains down
Black and white, the shades/ Nothing but a simple ruse/ To hide the spectrum
Shaking the monkey/Off of your back doesn't mean/The circus left too
different yet the same /half as much for twice as much/ /which has more to gain?
on opposite rails / two trains hissing to a stop / eyes meet through the glass
The road is dry now / But just ten minutes ago / The road had vanished
Up and down my mind goes / between sadness and pure bliss / Peace, a faint memory.
Drift with a lost soul/ appear like dust in sunlight/ always here but not
I always end up/ doing something wrong, but I/ don't know what I did
I fear not your "No." / My fear is that of your "Yes," / And my own heart's "No."
Spider works his loom / Prey squirms at his convenience / Unburdened by thirst
sorry to bother/it's snowing on mt. fuji/thought you should know that
Peace, but not quiet / Trains sound their solemn whale songs / We sleep at first light.
Multi Haiku poem
Simply Breathing in / Relaxing in the moment / Easily breath out
What happened back then? Were you there when we lost you? Are you hear right now?
electrons surging / bathing the leaves in white light / silence is extinct.
A redditor says / agender is nonsense / love you too reddit
electrons surging / bathing leaves in light / silence is extinct.

Humpday haiku
Depression my friend / We have been close for so long / Please just let me go
His void face tells all / and while he's isn't missing a thing, / he is missing himself.
Winter moon gazing /She always stares down at me / Wishing I'd join her
An errant thought dreads/The day my sweet Jellybean/Doesn't scratch my door
Hatred, lies, deceit/Poisoning my love for you/Yet it cannot die
Whipsering pearls/floating in deep blue/their ends; thin tendrils
his manly cologne / forestalls each likely approach / ironic or lame
Computer Over?/Virus Equals Very Yes?!/That's not a good prize!
Porcelain snail trails/ up and down the toilet bowl/ warning in the air.
his manly cologne / forestalls each likely approach / it rhymes with alone
Monster Ultra Blue
Expectations bind/ Freely travels the river/ Floating towards unknown.
I'm not sure if this is a haiku
Brother lies on road/Father shaking in his car/Mother screams a name
Pooltime Haikus
In the summer breeze a wisp of hair reaches her smile
they told me haiku/was five-seven-five not three/eight-four. here, fuck-face.
bought a new grinder/for coffee mostly/who has time for sleep?
Shooting dialudid/I am using a cock ring/as a tourniquet
Roaring footy crowd/Screaming sirens in the night/Chittering possums
Rain is so good/Unless it causes a flood/I pray to God
unripe plums/have a simple, intimate taste/dirt, leaves, branches
Each day grows darker/ I begin to feel more bleak/ my endgame draws closer
Milk, milk, lemonade / 'Round the corner fudge is made / Learn Anatomy!
Ice cream in the 'hood / Trucks have other goodies, too / "Try our new crack rock!"
communication / translating feelings to words / never comes out right
How fast goes the time, / And how slow progress appears. / Will it ever end?
the storm torrents, howls / steam, water, the sky is crying / showering, lights off
iridescence of / my reflection, impression / talks to me in tears
pepper jack, romaine / Frank's Hot Sauce, pesto, turkey / the perfect sandwich
Insomniac I rest / what an irony, isn't it? / the night is peaceful
Never quite broken / Never quite fixed, what am I / To do in between?
How funny it is / to be falling apart. Good, / Time to reconstruct.
Rage
Hikikomori / Gray clouds haunting my spirit / Pulling the trigger
Nothing is happy / Nothing holds my interest / I'm falling, alone
I tried not to fart / But then my hands got sweaty / So then they farted.
I just want to run / To fly far away from here / I'll be a pilot
I am a person / I don't feel very special / Or very happy
Pennies in a stream / falling leaves, a sycamore / moonlight in Vermont (find enclosed a song of Haikus!)
Midnight has arrived / The darkness oppresses me / and I can't get out.
Sleepless summer night / Staring at the screen like moonlight / Pray before daylight
Don't know where to go/The townsfolk are of no help/First buy white crystal
Haiku
Coffee hot in the/ Morning fulfills where life just/ disappoints mostly
Autumn
I read and reread / I go on walks, stare at walls / numb to my own screams
Neurotransmitters / affect fucking behaviors / science does not lie
'But it looked like fun' / is not a valid defense / in a court of law.
just friends, she and I / she leads, knowing I'll follow / her long skirt billows
Listen to their chat/ Some people are discuss(ting) / Living with talk-ture.
Insomnia
in grass, a dewdrop / kindly mirroring the moon / ripples ever out.
Pulling steadfast lines/ heavy is the hand of fate/ he quips, "does it hurt?"
Whisper me secrets/Tell me stories of regret/ So we may be close
Everything's fine, then / like a lightning in a blue sky / it comes back to you.
each stroke like daggers / a twist; the wrong back was cracked / four dollar massage
we all have demons / in a lonely subreddit / I chase mine away
When birds come, I come too / White stuff all around / You can't tell the difference
they stare and they smirk / it’s better to have no friends / than to have and lose
I felt a hard tug / I snap back to my shadow / I limit me
You can feel it/ Long before you see it/ Love is not weak.
it's all film, fleeting / i'm living without myself / numb and terrified
shimmering fractals / spirit of my mandolin / sound molded like clay
The sky is empty, gray / a personal atmosphere / mirror of my mind
I yell at the screen / 'Lady, run for it! You'll drown!' / Peter North prepares
Mark David Chapman / shot ex-Beatle John Lennon / with a sad, cold gun
"Lucy In The Sky" / Plays during the credits, and / everybody cheers

Big Auntie Maren / Her hugs soft, suffocating / a doughball of smiles
Hey I'm genderqueer / I'm a person, not a freak / I am simply me
A single snowflake / Never feels responsible / For an avalanche
the night auditor / types on the hotel PC / hmmm work or haiku?
Everything changed / Hope turned into blind fear / and love went missing.
Darkness consumes all- / Some recover their losses; / Others never do.
Flowers placed roadside / A telephone pole broken / Casseroles baking
How can I not wait/ For you if you go away /If you go away, hope
Fasting is today / I eat, but I decide not to / I want but I cant
I get paid to sit / behind an old hotel desk / world's easiest job
lost in time and space / till you shone in the dark sky / and guided me home
My face really hurts / I just wanted a sandwich / ...I'll make it myself
I had a feeling // that I could have described here // but, I'd rather not.
And again, he failed, / and a desperate cry rose up: / Goddamnit, Mr Noodle.

HELP - Create haiku about your love for PC gaming
As our two hands meet / my heart begins pounding harder / and she gives me a smile.
Again, fuck that shit / I fell, I died and I cried / every time. Dark souls
Bitter hardened snake / I'm a lemon to the core / I'll hiss and I'll bite
No one'll ever know / what goes down inside of my head / And neither I will
No true goal in life / Nor a plan to get there yet / refined composure.
Enjoying the view, / A glass forest glows at dusk, / two strangers acquaint.
refined, gallant curves / screeches like a red-tailed hawk / the Gibson Les Paul
cold as the arctic / smoky, flaming medicine / tall glass of bourbon
I gambled and lost / Appalling repercussions / Never trust a fart.
don't feel like a girl / and I don't feel like a boy / what am I? a freak?
Innocent snowflake / Falling to earth just in time / Turning red snow pink
I'm not poetic / Like many of you here are. / Any tips or hints?
Have you tried simply / communicating with these? / It's easy and fun!
The saturation/of the sky represented/by a sine function
Children hear gunshots / seeds of hatred are planted / young lives laid to waste.
My voice is breaking/with unenchanted lyrics/the same, stale old song
Summer has arrived/ The middle of a desert/Cooks egg on sidewalk
confessed all my sins / expecting a lightning bolt / with my name on it
firm wind blows in gusts / pushes against the frail body / as if made of straw
the great tragedy/ of my life is that i can't/ write everything down
forever thunderous / never ever a rain fell / your face in the apocalyptic sky
There are no lifeboats/ for this heavy, sinking heart/ only bubbles rise
the greatest comfort / is not love, friendship or joy: / my soft bed cushion.
one tab, the world swirls / two tabs, i know who i am / three, i'm an alien
[Book] The Divine Farmer's Renga
Kind of a long one/wrote this on the plane ride home/never done this before (actual poem in text, did I do this right?)
night ends on a truce / we sleep by dying embers / and trade warmth for dreams
green against sky blue/nature prevails above all else/succumbs to humans
speak broken language/make sense to myself;others/are confused. Shit...

I was in love with / the person I thought he was. / That person is gone.
Clinking through the trees / These trolleys are people too / All around the hills
A castle crumbles / the rook cackles loudly, then / defening silence.
I won't take the blame/ Pulsing veins in shaky wrists/ Not here, not like this
You ask, "Spare some change?" / I say, "Change comes from within" / Penny for your thoughts
Time is a fabric/ we wear it secure, until/ our thread unravels
I walk a long road / it has many diversions / each road ends the same
our moist tongues explore / then I wake, soaked on the lawn / your sprinklers are on
It swallows me whole / Modern-day Persephone / But the dark soothes me
A thought on smartphones
Mister Cardinal / Bright feathers dim underneath / The birdfeeder’s roof
Fabulous fireworks / Family and friends are near / Food and refreshments
it was the trees at my house / where i struck my great bell
Dogs out one last time / Technicolor sunset / Complete with fireflies
I looked for mine own / Among many blurred faces / Who am I today?
no stars in jersey / the sky is both pale and black / missing the white sparks
Put on Icy Hot / Needed to use the rest room / It was a mistake
mind irresolute / body irreddeemable / soul in bikinis
minutes pass / specks of dust landing / on the phone
I see harmless cat / he sees giant, fatherless / incompetent bird
Time goes in nights of/Poorly thought through roleplay and/Haiku caressed days.
What a great line, I / should write it down. Oh no, just / plagiarized Tom Waits.
Silent, misty-eyed/ she took the keys to my heart/ and locked herself out
Check out my karma. / I have also been gilded. / Forever alone.
Didn't sleep a wink/ eyes not working properly/ bloody hell I'm tired

Occupy my mind / and then satisfy my soul. / that's what I need now.
Haiku #1 the truth.
Mirrors in her mind / Smoke and fog are clouding mine / Match made in heaven
It is 3 am / I should go to sleep, just to / follow the real dreams
painting your portrait / I gesture wildly and howl / the canvas is blank
How do you feel now / Gazing at some distant world / Insignificant being
I am sad often. / Together we were perfect. / I am incomplete.
Clashing and tearing / Rough waves against a cliffside / My words displease me

Wall of rain for days/Technology washed away/Where is the coffee?
on Sunday morning / I rise up late, pour black brew / lie about my date
In a foreign land / She can still appreciate / What ties her to home.

there is no escape / happiness comes from within / death comes all too soon
I feel forever/Bound by these cold rusty chains/Eternally stuck
I feel forever/By these cold rusty chains/Eternally stuck
Jug o rum jug o / Frog on sharpened stick croaking / Pan full of legs
A fresh start today/Your old sun rises anew/The past is practice.

Crowded room/friends everywhere, chattering/yet alone, a ghost
Pouring rain all day / lashing the quiet city / hint of red twilight
Laying in darkness, Whispering ocean behind me, Like carpet flying East
I am an earthling/A harvester of the light/Weaver of the sun
Laying in darkness /'s Whispering ocean behind me /'s Like carpet flying East
Laying in darkness /s Whispering ocean behind me /s Like carpet flying East
Howling wind/blissful winter/calm mind.
my first haiku / unnecessary, coma / this is so meta
Blinding sun/sweat covered body/home alone

The man is tough nails / Dental chair reclines, "Open" / Trembling fawn on grass
The man is tough nails / Dental chair reclining, "open" / trembling fawn in grass

Shiny soft wet velvet/ Stiff intruding frisson/ Snug rhythmic glowing

What is existence/ A massive coincidence/ Or a master plan
The voice fades away/I thought I made a new friend/The Psychiatrist
My heart flutters by/ Into another's soft palms/ I hope she likes birds
I sit on my bed / thinking about you, darling / I sleep profoundly
Connect with others / We are bigger than ourselves / We are more than us
Darkness cocoons/The shell breaks open once more/Butterflies emerge
[INFO] The Haiku
each day is a song / notes fill it, all high and low / each in their own turn
Sleep deprivation / cubical anxiety / chronic depression
Warm caress of sun / The bed is empty alone / So I dream of you.
Writing mumbles, drunk / Fertile, young mind swimming free / Haiku? Gesundheit!

Haiku 24 - Out Of Reach
Mother calls my name/Must just be tricks of the wind/My mother is dead...
Sonic, the dog.
Came up with this while taking apart an old patio swing
A common problem: / after a successful night / I still feel useless
In the smoky hills
Its not clear to you? / My home's in the smoky hills / Beyond the treetops
only after death / did she look back with hate / on wasted sundays
I was a young buck / drinking from her, a river / swept down and spit out
Simple fact
What do you recommend me a translated Basio book ?
(3/5/3) - the old dog / musters some gruffness / for new guests
There are no strings on me
Regulars are here // Sitting drinking and talking // I'm sure familiar
Xenophobia:/Brothers when convenient/Else, cannon fodder
Virginal passport/Craves filling and torn pages/But pay-check says no.
I wanted to write a haiku / The blue line flashes / I'm done
a distant rumble, / it pauses my thoughts, I hear-- / the night softly rain...
This life hack will change your daily life
None in bowl or wipe / But I know there was a splash / Must be a ghost poop
the morning after / forgive others, and myself / there is only now
I fall and forget / Both the earth and I do spin / A dervish's whirl
These giant grass stains / The subtle hum of knee pain / Another great day.
Haiku is / three syllab / les in Ja..........panese
The loneliest man / unacknowledged even by / motion sensing sinks
swallowing itself \ continues making it real \ never ending void
Coming this summer / Sequel you can't wait to see / Life, uh, finds a way
along unnamed roads \ the path continues down stream \ life branches out
bright shiny morning / a day's wage for a day's work / eat, drink, bed, repeat
could should sometimes all / I never say “is” only “it might be” / I only like not love
Lack of passion, a symptom of moderation
a dog on a bed / "Joe Cocker being awesome" / an Instagram feed
A world in grayscale /morals are just conventions / good, bad, they're just words
When the light fades out / The mean whispers in my mind / Just won't let me be
Orange, red, yellow/ ignites the sky with colour/ until it turns blue
Silence is ongoing / yet music is within me / my mind is at easy
Windless, lake as glass. / Clouds reflect ghost fish, mere mirage. / Walking away... Splash!
She's so passionate / I fear she is too attached, / and yet, I stay here.
Sins of my father / My own mistakes as a child / These too I carry
The light will guide you / Through tunnels, dark rooms, alleys / Believe in your path!
I see and I do / The world will spin without me / Today is a new
Too much food to eat / Not enough condiments here / These first-world problems
Dear Dad
Your words are wounding, / your tongue is a scalpel and / your aim is perfect.
Australian Netflix / doesn't have Trailer Park Boys / only Freaks and Geeks
See what courage means / When fearful souls persevere / Into the unknown
Cloudy afternoon / Robin hopping up a hill / Searching for earthworms
I want to go more / such excitement waits for me / my body is weak
what is Amélie? / my girlfriend's favorite movie / I think that its French
When it's cold outside / Recall Spring's shimmering glow / Know it shall return
A springtime treasure / Hidden in fragile round pods / Morning Glory seeds
From the belly, breathe / A disciplined mind goes blank / Inhale and exhale
The Blade Wrapped In White
like scratching an itch / the river stretches and swirls / as my soul ambles by
Only six questions // who what when where how and why // now you know everything
You may have a cat // but then no Zen Garden is // possible as well
Dazed zombies gawking // smartphones tablets and selfies // disaster or not
unisex bathrooms / seem progressive until / guys piss on the seats
burgousie go down/ Full comunism for ever/ Long live the premiere/
swirling clouds depart / stones steam in golden columns / the forest drinks deep
the skies' tumult now passed / stones steam in golden columns / the forest drinks deep
thunder far, stones steam / an exhalation / the forest drinks deep
You have arrived/Just now. At the only place/you will ever be.
Immense tragedy/Earth breaks apart in seconds/Broken hearts linger
A haiku about how to make a haiku
Coldsmoke, a scotch ale / A well-loved and local beer / Bought it to be safe.
Smoking on a cold / night the only thing warm is / the roof of my mouth
Radiation spills, / silently spreads, trailed by death, / tomorrow we die.
Fingertips rub the rim / A rock skips the water's edge / Plop, plop, it falls in
Must be spring outside / A flat roof by the window / Two seagulls shagging
Ode to Friday
The sun shines on me / a feeling unfamiliar / embracing the mood
Puddles, a sad clown, / ignored in a coffee shop, / absolute genius.
Four red-winged blackbirds / At my backyard bird feeder / Causing a ruckus
Outside my window / Faint glow on the horizon / Birds calling welcome
A friday haiku
Airports, Turbulence / Meeting, Drinks, Airports Again / Dreaded Business Trip
Fluorescent-lit desk / Sunlight falls short of window / The birds sing for me.
A vicious tide rips / across the frazzled coastline / like time's ebb and flow
Gingerly they strode / Through explosions to and fro / Truly fearless souls
airports, turbulence meeting, drinks, airports again dreaded business trip
Trees decorated / With new leaves of bright chartreuse / And spent pod tassels
everybody thinks / they are above average / drivers, and lovers
Such a distant gaze./ Sun in the sky, does not shine./ Cloud of mind, too thick./
A low, silent stalk \ Ends with a swift deadly pounce \ Flesh and fur undone
I gently stroked him / lovers lying on the floor / never to meet again
The Suburbs
Cat walks silently/ Its wide eyes reflect the moon/ The breeze blows gently/
Green shoots reach for sun / like a child reaching for love, / yet snow still floats pass.
A Haiku story/ About my best friend and I/ My only true love.
Haiku #19 - Cups
I feel your heart beat. / Sometimes it matches with mine. / Sometimes it doesn't.
Wind rippled river / pruney fingers playing too / long in the water.
Social beings seek / Another to share our thoughts / Without it we're lost
Men living bright lives / Fighting far from their young wives / Fodder for cannons
Haiku #22 - Quit
Fear drives the lesser / Rots at the roots changes face / Mother Manipulates
My first Haiku on this subreddit (interpretation is left to the reader)
My first haiku post on this subreddit! (interpretation is left to the reader)
The Day Before Moving Day
it's too cold in here / air pumped through buildings' throats / eternal exhaling
A gust from the west / oaks sway in a friendly joust / sapphire skies keep score.
The moon's pale glow / is naught but a faint echo / of the bygone sun
Gray day on the porch, / my daughter talks quietly, / my love makes me smile.
We are but flashes / Of the universe's whim / Perpetually
Two suns set at once / One for you and one for me / Maybe we both watch
Streaks of light beckon / Infinity set ablaze / A grand horizon
A grand horizon / Streaks of orange and purple / Infinitely
Awake in darkness / Unknown eclipsing my thoughts / I want to escape
Zero Tolerance? / Extreme laws frequently mean / extreme injustice.
You talk in your sleep. / it wakes me up sometimes. / but I am smiling.
Cat strokes leg with tongue / Or, as my gramma would say / "Playing the cello"
I'm not perfect / but I love you just the same. / please don't forget that.
Interrogation. \ I know on which side to sit, \ despair stains that wall.
I tried to call you / no answer, only voice mail. / Your voice made me smile.
The birds are chirping / everybody's going to work / daylight is roaring
Hungry lambs cry out / Sometimes the mother attends / And sometimes the wolf
Count to one. Inevitably, you will win.
Dale "stopped using drugs" / then "cut his head on a fence" / he's probably on drugs
now at McDonald's / 100% Aussie / lamb and feta wraps
Photographic memory
Cats were making love / Against my house, in the night / Yowling in delight
limestone void dripping / reflecting in the darkness / memory's heartbeat
a bottle in hand / my fate is tied to your lips / champagne or whiskey
Ladies on pushbikes/Lycra clinging to smooth curves/Like caressing hands.
two police robots / used mechanical kung fu / against the suspect.
Morning just breaking / With birds singing in the trees / Greeting the first light
Moon isn't a grey rock / is an egg about to hatch / Space chicken coming
on Mardi Gras night / Asian tour groups take photos / of gay men dancing
Tired, exhausted / but we only get one life / get up and fight on
Pig-tailed energy, / flashes her gap toothed grin, shrieks, / and runs off again.
You complain often/ Either too much work, or none/ but you "love" acting?
Ugh! Monday again? / Yet another bleak work week / Then it starts to rain
Office boredom sucks/ Productivity dwindles/ Employees go mad
Lecture crawls forward/ Droning, his words mean nothing/ My own world beckons
Hum and rattling / of checkout line customers / Please get them away.
I woke up naked / Between cereal boxes / The store is busy
See our souls shattered / always oil and vinegar / I saw solid gold
a shattered teacup / we finish eating without / mentioning her again
a shattered teacup/ we eat without bringing/ her up again
Sharing my music / You'll have to remember me / when you're listening
I turn on my TV / I look down at my cell phone / am I even alive
Webs are everywhere / It’s a good year for spiders / For flies, not so much
The Center
My mind can't be still. \ Wondering what will happen \ when you get back home.
Depth of emotion / A suffocating ocean / Brutal devotion
Rain beats down outside / With a natural rhythm / My favorite song
My Milkshakes Bring Boys/Could Teach But I Have To Charge/They're Better Than Yours
Alone As I Stay/Raindrops Splash My Window And/Accompany Me.
Early morning rain / Robins patrolling the lawn / Worms on the sidewalk
Another day where / I try in vain to stay real / Leaving existence
You left anyway. \ My feelings don't matter now. \ I am numb inside.
She took her bra off/ She took her panties off too/ She had a shower.
I tried my hand at Haikus. A Haiku about a misty Japan.
After living in Hawaii for a year
Friends lost forever/ don't defend those in the right/ convenience strikes
hearing nothing / how awful hearing nothing / how beautiful
in tai chi it’s taught / what's stuck steals our attention / out of proportion
She giggles, then shouts; \ He grins at her, face wild; \ Lovers, caught in rain
Grown men who must drive Toyota Camrys
Techie duty calls. / 2.5 hours later, / Gram's laptop is clean.
Sometimes I slip out/Walking through the cold night/And I think of you.
I wanted to ask / why post poems in the title / and not the text box?
Haikublah
Rain falling gently, / the drums and foot steps in sync, / wish you could be here
The rain told me, with / His hand on my shoulder; "Yes, / The season has changed."
Overnight shift sucks/But I have some dro at home/My night should improve
5/7/5 - haiku
western wind prevails / a cold winter on its way / I wish you were here
Spring
A short fast paced hike/on a trail muddied from rain/sweaty, but yet cold
Because it's human/doesn't mean it's right. Likewise,/not all is as wrong.
Rolling down the road / Ripped jeans and a faded shirt / Just glad to be me
Sakura are shed / Magnolias in full bloom / Slimy paths ahead
Early, not yet day / A bird calls uncertainly / To the rising sun
Sakura are being shed / Magnolias bloom / Slippery pavements ahead
Cold tables, endless hum / waiting for the sunrise / sleepless nights are long
Tendrils hug the coast / the cultists chant ancient hymns / welcome, great old one
Broken promises / Lie tangled in the bed sheets / Never to be claimed
Little by little, / water breaks down the mountain, / until it's all gone.
A liminal place / where dusk waters meet nightfall / minutes past sunset
i, a fiddlehead / once, in a previous life / an inward spiral
i, a fiddlehead / once, in a previous life / an earthly spiral
footsteps on the sand / slight breeze from dark eastern sky / the ebb takes the blood
A steel-bound heaven / Wrought in grey and promised rain / The clouds blow away
I am a god who / people have not imagined / not yet spoke of me
Even though I know / you don't feel quite the same way, / you still feel something.
The night ends at last/But sorrow clings on yet still/Death is eternal
Mental screenshot thought / Bone and metal intertwined / Instagram wet dream
What is a haiku? / I really have no idea / Someone please help me
Fishing with my friend / The fair lake favors his line / Beautiful sunset
Glimpsed at change coming / Didn't bother to look twice / Gone now are those days
my friend mary jane / "frenemy" is more like it / need a different vice :/

Eight in the ev'ning / fatigue drains from my body / leaving me empty

Procrastination haiku
A lone stone goddess / Stands watch over sand and stone; / Nothing else remains.
The power of two \ is better than one all day. \ don't you see it too?
Moments are like waves / Memories course through my thoughts / Ripples of my past
laid my weary head / to rest upon her shoulder / gave in to the warmth
Peeing outside / A reflection in the puddle / The moon
Old Man's Haiku
I climb to escape/Meditate in low branches/My difficult tree
Picture me perfect/The way I wanted to be/The way I couldn't
Dream logic hallways / Viewed through grainy video / Glide with no tether
Why are everyone's haiku 5/7/5?
Port Authority / A vortex of misery / Thanks for your patience
i left part of me / i feel like I need it back / it's by your bedside
Slowly spring unfolds/Winter fights every step/Now, a weak snow falls
desperation seeps/ he picks up my putrid scent/ and is drawn to it
It’s quite warm for March / The low sun casts long shadows / On the painted wall
(Haiku traditionally aren't given titles)
You'll never know it/But you were my first since her/Greys Begin To Fade
I'd say I'm happy/No really that was awesome/TodayWasSoDope
I used to smell the rain/now I only step outside/to spit between drags
We just barely met/I'm not really complaining/But we should slow down
fleeting is the thought / here a second till it's gone / thoughtless I remain
All of her anger / seemed to have vanished. Inside/ it was just growing.
Schizophrenia/ I am losing my brother/ I can hear him cry.

Click this hyperlink / to read a haiku I wrote / for my cat La Forge
Former colonies / the prison and the spice field / leather versus oak
Tears rolling down cheeks / Computer screen glowing brightly / Lonely thoughts at night.

A slice of apple / Rests on my tongue so I may / Savor the sweetness
Look at that booty / she has hypnotic powers / sit on my face please
sense is for the sane / the proper and the civil / here we are all mad
Under the night light / he ignites the saviour / problems become blurred.
Congruent thoughts hide / what lies beneath cannot flow / but maybe I will smile
The night sky recedes / each star a candle alight / apart we share each
I am still alive/ Though barely breathing through it/ I'm not dying yet
Waiting for the dawn / I'll be better tomorrow / When will I wake up
Pooped my pantaloons / embarrassing walk backwards / God damn Chipotle
You had left my life/ I was happy without you/ Please do not come back
The weight presses down / the journey ahead is long / I sigh and move on
There is no perfect. / if you look for it you'll fail. / accept what you have.
Felt down and horny / Thought I just needed quick love/ Realized I'm lonely
Listen to the trees / As they rustle in blue skies / And the Huvan wind
In here you will find / The meaning of all / Walk the dinosaur
Sorted by top posts / "These aren't very good, are they?" / "Could I do better...?"
Please don't go to him. / it can't be worth it to you. / it is killing me.
You can't have your cake \ and expect to eat it too. \ But you have two cakes!

A glass of champaigne / solves every problem at work / bottle is empty
Failure tills the soil / Learn the lessons; sow the seeds / The plants will bear fruit
When I go doo-doo / My bathroom door is see-through / Therefore, I see you

Even though I know / every hug could be the last / i am still right here.

So much universe, and so little time
Everyone we lose / Imprinted like heart moments / Pining nostalgia

The day I met you, / some star far away died. I / don't believe in coincidences.
What we remember/It pales in comparison/To what we forget
Look over my screen / and out a distant window / a tree starts to green
Working while eating / My desk is my lunch table / I should take a break
My cat Mylo stares / Deep eyes penetrate through me / What is it he sees?
The rain hits my roof / Inside I hear its patter / Outside it melts snow
Through the open window / Crisp morning air chills my skin / As it warms my soul.
You are watching me. \ I have been watching you too. \ it doesn't matter.
Many Haiku here / But so sparse are the comments / It's so darned quiet
The joy of my heart / Where have you gone little one? / Lord, please give him back.
Sometimes I miss you / but you are a cheating whore. / Give my sweater back.
One day the rain woke / Me up high above the ground / Thunder inside me

Open handedness, / Generous as the blossom / Strong, a Mothers love.
Holy cow I forgot / There's a haiku debt to pay / My fingers must work
sometimes, showering / I wish I could wash away / and hide down the drain

Repetitions / I only want to live / I need an exit
The backs of my jeans / Heavy with cold misfortune / Then the sun breaks through

Best you ever had? \ Then why are you with him now? \ The grass isn't green.
Smoking on the street / covered in sunshine, when y'all / are stressed, I'm happy.

Memory
A long weary road / A tumultuous journey / In you I've found home
Dad is in my room / he died in an accident / why won't my pills work
Single strand of hair / far too long to be mine / all I have left of her
great sky, winter trees / new of death found me today / deep sobs with black coffee
cold snap, boiler dies / installed fourteen years ago / my shirts last longer
A normal outcome / makes the pessimists happy / and optimists sad.
I photographed you/ The moment sealed forever/ Even when you left
As a flower blooms/ Interrupted and distant/ A leaf always falls
With her knife made from / that word, 'No', I must act like / my heart has not stopped.
At the frequency / 2.45GHz / water is heated
moist sun steals tombstone / sometimes things don't make any sense / parallel sugar
It's always so cold / In the shadow of your doubts / Trust will warm us both
let us just be friends / every ounce of willpower / to force an empty smile
Laying down for rest/ Rising for dreadful labor/ The cycle repeats
The road of life bends / Unprepared for the sharp jolt / I spill my coffee
Sometimes all it takes / Is a single offhand glance / To change your whole life
this is not a gut / it is really a beer tank / for a love machine
I cannot express/ the tree's balletic movements/ is moonlight needed?
"I wouldn't hurt you" / then came the cheap alcohol / my dad spoke too soon
A glassless window / a purposeless creation / you left me unwhole
To my widowed wife / I chose not death over life / but death over you
My love is gone as / the leaves on autumn's first day, / waiting for my spring
Tattered clothes, bare feet / the changing sky is my roof / I am always home
cold grey dawn breaks / shut up cat, its barely six / hot black sweet coffee
Gathering corvus / A winged murder meeting / Cawing to the sky
Making up client / Is my job but tears are running / God, why my daughter?
I believed in love / she promised me the whole world / lies hurt sharper than knives
when you hear someone / tell the story of their life / you can't help love them
You are cold as snow / But when you smile you make me / Feel warm as summer
Your play just finished/ I wait with flowers in hand/ You walk by, they die
No happiness exist here/ No sadness exist either/ What a dull life lived
Alarm cat
I like your butt lots / It's nice and smooth and perky / I want to touch it
Sweet smelling red rose / how I yearn to caress you / ripping my hand's flesh
there on the surface/reflections ripple in time/dipping my toe in
I want a new drug / But one that won't make me sick / I'll just stick to weed
This is what I want / A pizza with anchovies / Hold the anchovies
I fucked Vin Diesel / Just to prove that he is a / Homosexual
A warm cup of tea/ brash and rich are it's colors/ the sun slowly sets
I hate you for not / Loving me and I love you / For not hating me
Making up client / Is my job but tears are running / God, why my daughter?
The snowflakes falling / in a cold pristine morning / Hope they don't find me
"don't put all your eggs-" / that’s fine for you, with plenty / I just have one egg
i use dryer sheets / i'm not sure they really help / but still, just in case.
with the snow falling / my heart sorts through old papers / memories, snow plows
Little dancing flame/ Warms my darling golden brown/ Cold steel now stained red.
Incomplete person/Even put together well/Still cannot function
Saturday morning/Reddit, coffee, scrambled eggs/Weekends are awesome
Longing for embrace/ the ocean floods and rushes/ upward toward the moon
we take the low path / together we sit and stare / at the sea quietly
thank you, evil crutch / concoction of liquid flame / you helped me fail her
Sunny day, good mood / Deals are sealed, beer in the fridge / Home at 3 PM
I feel like I'm sick / it's been days since my last one / curse you cancersticks
just a few more sips / oh whiskey help me forget / that she is no more
Stumbling in the light/Drowsily searching for you/Wake up sleepy head
The weight of the world / Upon my shoulders I bear / Humbly I submit
Ashes land on me
Snow falls quietly/Shutting the whole city down/Why will it not stop
Cigarettes burnt out/ The letter laying near me/ She's gone for good
Learning japanese. My first haiku.
I've been chasing you / beyond all course of reason / I guess you're my type // You didn't wave bye / In that one moment I knew / I should stop trying // But I don't know how / Just flat out reject me, just / go on make it hurt
fish below the ice / swim safely until spring thaw / and the tigers return
Sown the seeds of hope / Showered with drops of promises / Reap disappointment
There is a swift click / Time lapsing, a distillant / Compressed eyes need sleep
I look to my past / There is brightness and sunshine / But today is grim.
Thoughts of you won't leave/Eating. Sleeping. Why bother? /Please come back to me.
Tears soothe burning eyes/Overcome by passion's flames/All just a mirage
Hoping to reach you/ I wrote my words on birch bark/ and set them aflame
Weeks and months have passed/ Yellow light through wire glass/ Sticker - "visitor"/
the hardest part is / forgetting those you swore you / would never forget
Mile upstream from you/Thoughts adrift, wondering if/Either of us (k)new
endless time exhausts / my weary soul silent hears / the clock tick onward
A fool's thought is such/ Believing that an old love's lust/ Could bring joy again
Coffee for breakfast. Feed your addiction my friend. Got to have sweets too!
girls like that crush on/ guys whose plans don't last from/ sun break to lunch break
Clarity of thought/Illuminating darkness/Truth reveals itself
darkness surrounding / with no luster to be seen / hope for light one day
Jorge Luis Borges - 17 Haiku (my translations)
a gust of cold wind/dying flame; ashes remain/part of my past, lost.
there are two of me / one is easily discerned / the other, you leave
An old sake set/ Dark green with a ruddy glaze/ Used to drink green tea
I am on Reddit/ wasting away my short life/ oh look a narwhale
a red sun rises / beyond ice-laden branches / the northern wind howls
dreaming in the dark/ dreaming funny, furry cats/ and of pretty girls
As I gaze upward, / a vein of stars glows above / and flows north to you.
Humans are PCs / Genetics is our OS / Nurture is our apps
Forsaken at birth / The world seems too alien / How do I exist?
Turned away. / So much to give you. / Please let me.
You like potted plants / And maybe a well written haiku / Enjoy your new mug
"Vladimir Putin / Doesn't care about black people" / Says Kanye West-ov
Depression, I have./ It is not heavy sadness,/ but numbness instead.
Don't speak her name here/ I'll remember how it hurt/ And how I miss her
a breeze from the south / brings the sweet of neroli / cherished in my heart
Like the shore and sea,/ touching, but always apart, / we pull and recede.
A commuter's haiku
when I see you there / out of reach but still close by / excitement fills me
Just another day / My heart crumbles and mind breaks / Such great depression.
This is a Haiku / This bit's seven syllables / Please upvote this post
I work on a lot. / Come see me for the best deals. / Lemons left and right!
Her quiet shadow / Stops under the bedroom door / Then scuttles away
Breathing in softly / Holding your head against me / The air is sweeter
My scarlet letter/Select from the alphabet/Time for public shame
I just realized / the distant light you seek may / be by the Baltic Sea.
Should I not be here? / Tell me, does it help or hurt? / I can disappear.
Yellow sticky notes/ For task lists and phone numbers/ Company pen runs
Wherever there is darkness / Burn, my little light / Burn, and push the dark away
Beautiful wet doggy / Harder harder harder / Quality napkins on sale
(3/5/3) - a lone tree / stands in silhouette / crimson skies
brightly the moon shines / on branches of oak and ash / leaving faint shadows
wifi in cambridge / it's open to the public / bathrooms need a code
red and yellow blobs / apples resting in the bowl / I find I'm hungry
Life is but a game/ but you will only win life/ once you have lived it.
I am new to here / But I've done haikus before / test post plz ignore.
What did the dog say / when his owner bit him back? / Nothing. He killed him.
There are certain songs / that you will forever own. / My heart sings them still.
Even now, tiger,/ I will watch you through the grass, / gazing from afar.
I need you here, love. / Bring light to this darkened room, / the black consumes me.
Both the cats have colds/They know it won't rain indoors/Both curled up snoring
One more day of rain/Clouds fight on Elephant Mountain/Dragons in my mind
Purple pen/ chocolate milk/ together
Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature and History - The best book on haiku I have ever read
on my throbing neck / your fingers felt like linen / I hid in the crowd
You wake up to a / tangle of limbs, your body / all wrapped up in his.
and if you can't be / with the one you love, honey/ love the one you're with
Baby is sleeping / Why am I on Reddit / God I'm so tired
Folds make mysteries / the human origami / like stories, unfolds
Vodka is courage / Also it tastes like fire / Mostly it's fire
Eating nice biscuits, with a lovely cup of tea, there are none left
Amazon told me / box delivered yesterday / where is my package?
Drowning in my mind / The void opens up to me / May I let go now?
Batch process 'complete', / some records failed silently. / No news is bad news.
Technicolor dream, / filled with such vivid color, / fades to black and white.
We work together / I procrastinate alone / The buddy system
Wind shakes my abode / Raindrops play magic music / Shift the blanket. Bliss.
each monday I count / birds covered in fresh white snow / fallen from windows
TV is damaged / Mr Snuffleupagus / Burned into its screen
until the sailboat / loses sight of the old land / it won't reach the new
mid day; book in hand / light's gentle brush strokes the wall / music faintly plays on
I can't speak Hebrew /but I can say "מדבר עברית / אני לא"
The girl bleeds for days / A tourniquet wont stop it / Only chocolate helps
I'd as soon leap in / that crush of people as the / january sea
local coffee house / dark droplets on white china / voices hum brightly
snow, to rain, to ice / keep my cocoa warm, baby / I will be home soon
The Storm
Will he be on time/ For the first time in a week?/ Two minutes to go.

Haiku for the Japanese Hostages

the morning has come / sun draws lines through the open blinds / breathe deep and stretch

You made me brazen / enough to call my words art / How Stupid is that?
Ours is subtle / karmic retribution; you / working down the hall.
Ours is subtle / karmick retribution; you / working down the hall
Prideful and certain/ Or pushover and unsure/ Which is worse anyway?

Evil white powder/ is tumbling from the sky./ This is not okay.
A bit of what I have found in my short time reading on the nature of haiku and their structure: 5/7/5, English Vs. Japanese Form, and the essence of Haiku.
Billions of people / Living well beneath their means / It's the only way
Meow, she cries out / she springs, wild around the house / what a nut she is
yell tirelessly / shoveling concrete laughing / loud sounds change cities
Changing minds can't make / guarantees that never end. / Hearts do every day.
Far away we looked/Distant on the horizon/yearning for a change

on the leaning fence / snow piling up in the shapes / of long white mountains
Forty-eight years old/Likely, life half way finished/Just live each moment
Utter excellence/ To call upon history/ Bill, Ted and Socrates
Afternoon rainstorm / Urbanites all complaining / Farmers thanking God
The grass is not green / when you look over the fence. / it's an illusion.
Weekend just for us / gone before it really starts / for monday threatens
Whiskey and plunder / I take what I want with my / thunder down under
Haiku pour la victoire
A moment to halt / makes for a better thinking / just take the air in
Just last night it snowed / the top of your tree covered / they wish you were here
American flag / is striped with red and head by / fifty white assholes.
The mind in stillness / Does not reside in one place — / So it's everywhere
Rush Hour Apology I’m sorry I trashed/ your car but your vanity/ plate made me do it.
Building a castle / High walls but they just don't care / It's all against one
Brush stroke, pencil mark, / like rain on the water, it / changes the canvas.
Building a castle / High walls because they don't care / It's all against one
Only a thin space / rattlesnakes and saguaro / dry air holds no rain
Shitty Haiku, Shitty Life
tired in the morning / thoughts awry when the sun rises / i need coffee, soon
Business wisdom says / Spend money to make money / Then spend that as well
I feel so alone/ What can I do to fix this?/ Nothing seems to work.
Miriam
Lupe Fiasco / sure lives up to his last name /with this new album.
Selfish egos are / Banana peels just waiting / To give you the slip
If the shirt I wear / is Hanes by Michael Jordan, / Why can't I slam dunk?
From the other side / Of a white-washed wooden fence / I can hear my voice.
from another room / a raspy, rising cackle / as her mood changes
Whirlwinds of feathers/ Black and brown twisting, dancing/ Intertwined in space.
Today you are the light/ Life is standing in your awe/ This is how to live.
Lost in the souls eyes / you have all of me and mine / lost but i hold on
some things you can change, \ some things are just meant to be. \ you have a choice now.

Paintings on the walls / Where man first placed his hands; this / Was the first artwork.
Here's a dirty thought / I've got a throbbing sausage / the pig's not dead yet
Anxiety
To plump Mother Earth
Does the flying bird / Say that it lives on the earth / Or in the blue sky
Your ink shadow, haunting / She says she can't draw for shit / So why do I cry
Right words, wrong meaning/Love is a foreign language/lost in translation
Help me I am stuck / In a haiku factory / Save me before they-
Red roses, blue vi- / Oh, what would old Shakespeare do? / No, sonnet's too long.
See the Earth blue green / look across space until Moon / space all planets fit

Break Up Haiku
Your birthday's today/I called you and sang the song/Masochist I guess
This could be lame/I haven't made one before/I gave it a shot
Zippers should be black / so if your pants are unzipped / nobody sees it.
My safe oasis, / her voice is soothing and bright. / I will never leave.
the distant love
Age of the sadness/ Measured with ticks on my skin/ Like rings of a tree.
I'll never be done. / She's already forgiven. / She just has to try.
She claimed to love God. / She obviously didn't. / She was blasphemous.
you have the best smile \ i will miss it when you're gone \ will you miss me too?
you know how i feel \ but that doesn't change a thing \ you've already left
I'm done with her now. / She had too many chances. / I've moved on from her.
you hurt me so much \ but i would do it again \ just to be with you
Now, it's way too late. / My heart has become a stone. / There's no place for love.
i can't sleep tonight \ so i will write a haiku \ because i lost you
Life never ending/ An eternity ahead/ When will it all end?
Many voices cry / In a scandalous uproar. / Yet, only one speaks.
i spilled out my heart \ so you could rip it in half \ why did i do that?
The postseason
All I see is sin. / Evil doers surround me. / I'm the one to blame?
I am a yo-yo. / pulled back and forth by your love. / which one is it now?
It's true: I'm angry. / What would you expect from me? / I'm treated like shit.
I'm miserable/ so i bet it all on you / i lost everything
Love sets a fire/ Fires go out, but with her/ That flames gunna burn.
I've saved all her things/ In hopes that one day she will/ Give back my DS.
Death's, wisping, quick grasp / Cutting skin, slicing through bone / No scars left behind
Today's a new day. / I need to feel loved today. / Tomorrow's too late.
Daily haiku
The nighttime poet, / A regular character, / Just missed his last chance.
Why, Long John Silver's, / Must we always meet at my / Lowest point in life?
I can't be your friend. / I love you too much for that. / I can't love two girls.
Happy man. / "There is nothing more I want in life," he sings. / Alarm rings.
Don’t do it again. / Don’t play with another heart. / Don’t say, “I love you."
At least it was me. / Most people couldn't take this. / Better me than them.
Ate panda express / Felt so good in the moment / Stomach ache regrets
Heavy metal sighs / as the night plumage blooms with / anticipation.
Bless your journey home / Through your deepening unknown / One, but not alone
Life is worse than death. / Life is full of oppression. / Death will bring freedom.
A lonely candle/ Tiny, afraid of the dark/ Almost out of wax
April's flower / greeted ninety-five spring dawns / falls to winter frost
Gravel between toes / The journey has only begun / Spirits guide me home
This meme just triggered a haiku conversation between my brother and I
Inside me you burst / You might be the death of me / Appendicitis
Fuck life and fuck love. / Neither have any substance. / Both are just torture.
made a free game with a friend that has a user-submitted haiku gallery-- Write one!
What am I to think? / She contradicts her own words. / Actions scream the truth.
She knows I'm lonely. / She said she cares about me. / She won't talk to me.
real street magician/turning tricks gasps of pleasure/never-ending show
I've come to embrace / Dissipated illusion / Dis-illusionment
There is a something / That's also everything / And still is no-thing
A smoking hot blonde, / Dove straight into the park pond, / I used gas and fire.
Poems can be short / Or they can be very long. / This is a haiku.
Drunken bums fighting/Over half a cheeseburger/Sad bike trail beatdown
refuse christmas tree / blowing though the chilly wind / like a tumbleweed
My beautiful sky, / your love and touch are missed. / Pangs of guilt remain.
Lucky to be free.../I got pulled over last night/I had been drinking
We made some mistakes. / They all tried to bury us. / Turns out, we were seeds.
The tiger rises. / I longed to see him once more. / I'll cherish this day.
Japanese gardens, / with their still, flower-trimmed paths, / remain in my heart.
i'm growing tired / of this life i did not want / it's time that i left.
Meant for greatness, we/within each soul so tiny/ broken universe.
BROCK MAKE HAIKUS
this haiku is yours \ as are all of the others \ i am yours as well
since i first met you \ my life has changed for the best \ you are amazing
Emptiness fills me / Where has my little fox gone? / I love you always.
Respect your woman. / Let her know she is special. / Show her that you care.
Wrap twice, create once/rainbow flowing from needles/love adorns their necks
I live with a girl / Her constant lies betrayed me / She lives alone now
Exhilarating/No drug greater than travel/Best high in the world
Wake up from the sun / Then just lay there for a while / Til I have to pee
She fell five stories./Did she yell Geronimo?/The news says maybe.
Ger-o-ni-mo!/Did she say it out loud as/she fell five stories?
It's cold here tonight, / but I think of the fires you made. / Ghostly ash endures.
Through sobs, sins, and more, / you were the one I adored. / Unheard. Unseen. Dumb.
I want to be dead. / I don't dare to kill myself. / I should take Chantix.
She brought me to life. / She showed me that I'm worthless. / She put me to death.
I don't love my life. / I would die for anyone. / For her, I would live.
Tensioned capsule/ bobbling, breath is held/ bob~bop, ★click★, Gotcha!
I am whole, perfect/ you too are truly loved/ what we shall asume
She must hate my God. / She clings to someone who does. / She says they're alike.
I sailed a smooth sea / Then I hi your hurricane / What a charming mess
A Haiku of Haikus
People live for sex. / It’s a shallow way to live. / I want more than that.
The first kiss of snow / blanket-like on empty house / turns to tears of rain
Watching for the storm / staring out into the night / waiting for the dawn
He curses her God. / If she really does love him, / She doesn't love God.
People claim to care. / They don't want to look heartless. / And so they pretend.
365 Haiku Challenge
A lover's flame lit / beneath this sorry hide, but / it fizzled too soon.
Feed me some bullets. / Let me die before I wake. / Life is too painful.
Lost and found, old flame/Once lovers, now online friends/My heart still smolders
I'm always alone. / I'm craving companionship. / I want to be loved.

Quetzalcoatl / underwent his crappy new / apotheosis
Lonely, lonely man / sits alone on New Years Eve / "Next year things will change"
post your new years eve (2014/2015) Haikus here.
I loved Mr Big / he didnt feel it, so thats it / I will die alone
you kiss like a goat \ and that is not a bad thing \ it is just funny
One singular tear/ fell, like my axe on the oak/ cleaving pith to bark
tomorrow is new \ it makes me nervous for sure \ but it will be fine
Mark my words baby / A thousand poems because / I'm coming for you
a smile I see \ im very familiar to \ familiar indeed
you melted my heart \ when you looked me in the eye \ i'll never let go
The Party pt 1
The tar fills my lungs / frozen air hangs around me / I exhale relief.
Chameleon climbs / the highest branch in the night; / All hope is not lost.
Over on Facebook / For a year only haikus / omg this sucks
On my way back home / i miss my dog and my girl / it was nice to leave
At the end of night, / where streetlights grow like tall grass, / I found you waiting.
It's hard to see you; / your light evaporated. / No more warmth remains.
2014
I love you so much/ All that I want to do is/ Get drunk and hold you
walk in the woods / a moment of consciousness \ this should clear my mind
There's this wannabe/ angel at my church and he/ won't stop ringing bells
She writes poetry / in the arms of dawn, falling / in love with the world
Toast is burnt / black as a piece of coal / love carcinogens
dont want no woman / no woman no cry no cry/ just leave me home please
As the birds flock south/A never-ending sun sets/And my time will rise
Will my past mistakes/Prevent me from achieving/All of my desires
so appreciate / to which you are not deserved / so to everything
so appreciate / that which is not deserved /so to everything
Best present of all / family not coming up / Christmas is cancelled
That moment after arrhythmia / heartbeat returns to normal / a new lease on life
I have a plan
Any haiku will/Sound good if Zer0 reads it./Right, subreddit guys?
Who is it?
My future prospects / Bright like shining stars above / Behind clouds mostly
Kiss of the Narcissist
I travel the lands / asking rides of kind strangers / I'm a hitch-haiku
I feel you slipping \ how can i convince you not \ to give up on us
The lifeless bodies/Falling forth like leaden rain/In practice at least
The land of the free / and the home of the frightened / of North Korea.
Grendel has been slain; / His arm hangs from the ceiling. / Rest In Peace, Asshole.
Like the bird of fire/ I wish to be reborn and / reach some place higher
/r/movies banned me and made me apologize in haiku in order to lift the ban
just before bedtime / my friend's baby so happy / to bang on the bell
Christmas is coming. / Forget presents. All we need: / to be together.
Before I met you, / love songs were just words and notes / but now they're alive.
So still my own pulse,/ It moves my hand hanging limp/ Alone drunk, sitting.
Frost in the desert. / A name etched into the sand. / "Pobert." No. "Robert."
Our paths intertwine / Yours running roots into mine / Explore love with me
Underneath, Cloudy/A few Flakes whip in the Wind/Eyes, Heavy with Her
i was born today \ before we met i was blind \ thanks for waking me
Moon in puddle now / chased by water drop stars / kitten shaking paw
Bow legged and hunched, / the hermit comes to rest on / a mossy boulder.
At the Spider Inn/ All flies are welcome to rest/ On the finest beds
He lay still, tattered / Seeking, looking, just one gasp / Godspeed strapping lad
"Farewell Suder. May / your death bring you the peace you / never found in life."
a perfect moment \ happened when i was with you \ i want another
you consume my mind \ with thoughts of love and joy \ you are beautiful
the way you can move \ attracts me like no other \ you hypnotize me
And I said to the sinner/Please do not worry/There's still room in heaven.
Reading on the couch / cat sleeping on my ankles / purr-fect contentment
A moment of peace / we had such a silly fight / is this truly love?
Where did the moon go? / Someone left it in my yard / tiny, still puddle
Wake up reluctant / Too cold to get out of bed / But I have to pee
So much love\In every bite of\Cheeseburgers
Tired souls gather / Blank stares; dead words on bright phones / so near, yet so far
the bat screams silent/ up is down and down is up/ plunge into the night
I'm ignorable/I am ugly as fuck too/This is my haiku
Guess who my good friend | Your hands smell like Doritos | Oh sorry my bad
Grow strong from within/Stand firm, branch out, endure, thrive/Majestic tree friend
What's Dangerous?
december snow day / the kitten's pneumatic breathing / keeping time for me
An ancient Evil/ Given life by apathy/ Indefinitely haunts
Question about haikus
gotta catch em all / one hundred and fifty is / enough pokemon
Mad shrieking baby / Suddenly, self awareness / Velociraptor
I gave you my flaws/ you turned them into diamonds/now they feel like ice.
2 cups on table / Back again, where it began / "Table for one, please."
First haiku ever / What is this life without games / One shot, no respawns
Frustrating
Haiku response to a WordPress Daily Post challenge:
Music starts to play. / People smile and dance away / worries. Joy remains.
Waiting for the shrink / About to spill out my heart / Why is it so hard
Consumerism / Tis the season, shop and spend / As programmed to do
Five haikus
Viewing Christmas lights/Glisten like tiny jewels/Through my tears; alone
The wolves are calling / Howled be their holy names / As three protect me
In her hands I could/realize just how pale mine were./Now, they're just pale.
Been through a ringer/ It is time, let me dry out/ Worn but still wearable
Winter frosts over/ This journey radiates warmth/ Summer left in wake
thou are the flower/our eternal love, the stem/the journey, the thorn
Trusting her my flaw/Enchanted by her beauty/We all make mistakes.
bare, gripped with terror/ "forget vocations," i cry/ "i am free to love"
Society shuns / The unknown, the unwanted / Welcome to Facebook
A half-empty glass/ Is half-full of potential/ Best served with passion
You're like inception. / I wake up in a new dream / each and every day.
In the fading light/ I sit alone and wonder/ what I could have learned.
Where did my youth go?/I have my grandmother's hands./My soul is still young.
the chi flow through me/meditated for quite long/oh it's vanished
Having met this girl/I have felt so incomplete/I should ask her out.
A new Widow / A new crib / A new grave
Winter. More winter. / I blink. Spring, summer, fall; gone. / Winter. More winter.
Sometimes I feel like/ a seagull in a snow storm/ white on white and grey
Let's lie and plug in / To each other's fantasies / Lost in the pillows
A sunrise smile/ Able to brighten the room/ And part stormy clouds
brought it on myself / I fell in love way too soon / does she love me back?
The Job
Did something stupid, someone caught it on camera. Reddit is my life.
Mario Party Haiku: I was in last place / And you stole my only star / Wow, go fuck yourself
Fly buzzes too close / Man swats it dead, just as a / Cow swats fly with tail
This Haiku's the best / There's never been one better / Nor will there ever
two little white moths / cruise softly by my campfire / November evening
Every great journey/ Begins with a single step/ Strap on some good boots
the broom is broken/my dog sleeps on it's old bed/furs are on the floor
My circuits alight/A poem idea that's bright/For you, this I write
Twin pools blue as ice / twin depths unknown freezing and / cold will they not thaw
The water bowl full / silence greets the traveler / alone with the moon
TIL when installing Firefox, you get a haiku
Clouds laugh ’til they cry/ At jokes told up in the sky/ Over our heads
Petal percher/Virgin of the tomb/Flutters forever
great skies over my head/all the birds are singing now/too blue to be true
top shelf where they keep/ the peanut butter and jam/ that's where he put it!
Filled with energy / A non-stop rollercoaster / It's just so boring
Yes, love is a choice / you choose who you want to love / and hope they pick you
life is the calm that / precedes a violent storm / of retrospection
using a haiku / generator, does it work / can anyone confirm?
i fear my government/take my hand my dear good friend/we fight this bad band
The tranquillity / That comes from the purest source / I drink from your eyes.
Lost in the city / My dreams and hopes await me / Should have brought a map
She left. I can't sleep./My daughter moved to Japan./One out of the nest.
Late every night/ We looked up towards the sky/ But there were no stars.
I wish you were here / now you are so far away / i miss you so much
The first kiss of snow/ Delicate upon the house/ Lips as cold as ice
World war 2 haiku I made
Thanksgiving
turkey and a ham / eat till that belly bursts wide / then eat some more pie
Placing my ear to / My cat's tummy to hear the / Sound of crackling fire

Here are the first four I've ever written. I had fun coming up with them. Take a look!
Flower on my head/ My face a fine garden bed/ Petals for a nose
Wake up inside it // Seems we blur the lines each day // Light up your love lives
Mother wind nudges/Insists I fly before her/I fart, noisily
Your eyes are a fire. / a blue flame that sees inside / my heart and my soul
In the morning sun / Flights of leaves take off like birds / In the winter wind
Love is confusing/makes me want to run away/but only with you
cat on countertop/the owner won't discipline/makes me want to kill
Dreaming together / Gentle snow plots destruction / —Biding avalanche
we met long ago/you were the man in my dreams/i still remember
Cold
I find peace inside/ even in the heat of war/ I find solitude.
Glad I’m not paying/ An insurmountable debt/ higher ed, **bold**The Game.
In the reddit plains. [Funny]
Is it so bad then / For to be misunderstood / Is the sweets and sours
Electric dancing/ Cool blue coursing through my veins/ Lightning on my feet
I seek to cure what's / deep inside, frightened of this / thing that I've become.
knowledge is power / some things are not symmetric / is power knowledge?
Fart Fart Fart Fart Fart / Big willies and bigger boobs. / I'm too immature.
Smoke stacks in their mouths/ Tobacco noose around necks/ Courting the reaper
Today I wrote a haiku in japanese. I have included the japanese, romanji, and english translations.
Weekday hangover/Why did I go out last night?/Right, Taco Tuesday
Golden leaves/shedding dappled light/ - precious moment
Need to break routine/ The monotony must stop/ Maybe rob a bank
I've never written haiku. I got bored and tried. Are these even haiku?
I was bored in class so i tried to write these three haikus. They probably suck because I've never written any before but whatever I guess.
I was really bored during class so I wrote these haikus. I've never written one before so they probably suck but whatever I guess.
You say you'll never / go home. But the truth is that / you never left it.
Small gardener/your memory sleeps in/autumn leaves
Future streaks across/the sky, a bright meteor/past but dim shadow
"It's only money" / "You cannot take it with you" / Winter cuts deeply.
Your words break on me/like arrows to a mountain/I will not be moved
Standing on the edge / of a well leading inward, / I can only sigh.
Our conversations / were complex and awkward and / simple and perfect.
My first haiku..
frowning dinosaur / a dilapidated pet / no cow big enough
Hands wrapped around you / with flat palms demanding warmth / thirst unrequited
As the seasons change / every leaf on every tree / falls into the mulch
Fancy armor does / not help. The sphinx's eyes see / straight into your heart.
first solemn snow falls / to find earth to melt away / and finally rest
Just lost my pet :/
Sunset
When I close my eyes / I see that I am my own / Worst adversary
It's nine-eleven/I feel unpatriotic./ Bombing in toilet.
I can make you laugh / But because you hate my guts / I can't make you smile
Waiting for finals / Ready to fail so hard / Fuck should have studied
at the beginning / and the end of this poem / a cat in my lap
the thief left it behind / the moon / at my window
The Winter
Count all the pebbles,/When you can’t find any rocks,/Let alone boulders.
My super power:/Aiding conversation flow,/And well-timed nodding.
i tasted your love. it was so delicious that / i wanted some more
i tasted your love. / it was so delicious / i wanted some more
I woke up smiling / and it took just a moment / to remember why.
Rain from everywhere Or A friend's hand out of reach Dampen a lone soul
How are you? They ask. / "I am not doing so good" / turns into "fine, thanks."
Fine line in between/Fantasy, reality/Intoxicating
Fluorescent glimmer/ Albatross look and wonder/ Why stars are below
Completely truthful / about his dishonesty; / I trust him for that.
Marriage
A tree had to die / so they could make a barrel / to age this whiskey.
Can i touch your butt? / it looks really nice to me. / let me touch your butt!
Cool autumn porridge/Pain au chocolat in hand/I hear the tram's hiss.
My church is simple / I tell you my sins and seek / heaven in your bed
clouds release their rain / violent winds suddenly arise / the dog needs to poop
I am not myself / but not not myself either / trapped; alone with me.
The bronze coloured leaves / Floats down the streett, as the wind / Whistles your way home.
Socially awkward / Making everyone else suave / My gift to the world
Nothing witty to see here!!!
Gone laughing mad / With dancing crimson smiles / I really hate clowns
CONFLUENT HOMEWORK, HOW YOU PRAWN THE RESIDUE. HOW YOU COUGH THE BISQUE.
What happened to you? / everything was beautiful. / but then you got scared
tiny sentences / paperweights on picture books / odd how vast and deep
you tore my heart out / because you were too afraid / to try something new.
Every single / Dream of you splits the seconds / I'm only awake
I am drawn to her / the same way a moth is drawn / to an open flame.
why are you running? / you can not hide from yourself. / just face all your fears.
The past forgotten/The present passing right through/The future a haze
Rotating password / Complex enough for safety / Kills the n00b's phone
When you clear a jam/Do it very carefully/Because you can die
My dreams are skittish; / I'm unsure of what they mean, / but please don't wake me.
Tom Magliozzi / Your Dart is waiting for you / Laugh the night away
Amidst urban sprawl / lies a beating heart of stone; / there is no way out.
Stardust in full bloom, / the universe subjective. / Matter moves matter.
I wrote this haiku for a fundraiser. PM me if you want details.
Hello anyone / Have you an invitation / To haikuary ?
A fear of falling / Cannot be felt from the ground / It shows you've climbed high
Hallowe'en night rain / whipped by chill autumn wind. / Sadly no thunder.
Million raindrops fall / loudly but not enough to / drown her "I love you"
The silence kills me / Long pauses after questions / Like do you love me?
This girl in my bed / Means nothing to me, but you / Wouldn't care at all
Eight hours of work/ Until I start the weekend/ Seems like forever
sitting at a desk / my hands do not create my / sorrowful mind sighs
god's own monster truck / satan's bazooka roaring / ninja apostles
one night, silently / the heart will break; come morning / you will find it gone
This is a haiku
Kansas City cheers / the Royals will take the crown / been twenty nine years!
City lights shining / Reflected in still waters / On a moonless night.
I am so horny/Why won't she play with my balls?/Just color me blue
I dreamt big mountains / then awoke and remembered / how stupid I am
Lying somewhere cold and dark, Jobs // Felt Pangu's Finger / Up his Arse.

following the sound / of the bell with the bell -- / still missing something

looking for old sparks / but there are none to be found / a new fire has lit

Sweet and strong and kind / he is after my own heart / as he's collecting
Sitting in a chair, / waiting for enlightenment; / autumn leaves fallen.
I am leaving now/do not fear, I will be back/say's his pokerface
psychedelic day/everything exists together /I am but one man.
Headlights shimmer / rain-soaked pavement. then gone. / stillness unbroken
Leaves falling from trees/Like ideas from the mind/of one without belief
leaves fall from trees like/ ideas from the mind of/ one without belief

Damage into strength / Solitude forged into bonds / That makes a phoenix
Caution into trust / Madness into clarity / That makes a phoenix
All love becomes rare/ all our little fantasies/ erased by a frost.
Cold Winter's mighty blow/ The snow now soaked with blood/ A tear drop falls below
Code unreadable / A stable and silent compilation / Dragons in the code
What was the start of / all this? When did the cogs of / fate begin to turn?
The party's in the / other room. Feel free to leave / at any moment.
You ride very well / on that fine looking high horse / but let's walk awhile.

These hot summer nights / Feel like cold winds in this house / Without you darling.
Going with the flow / But anchors are arising / With nearby floaters
Falling asleep now / did look forward to meet you / you didn't reply
I need to create / Something that truly lives on / Just not a baby.
The darkness descends/an infinite, cold blanket/that warms my dead heart.
The airplane told me / "We are not of green and blue;" / "No, the earth is white."
'you refuse to sink,' / but the sea doesn't know why / you deserve to float
naked in the rain, drinking cold beer and sake, plotting your demise
Moths.
The stars in the sky / Watch silently from above / As you dance below.
I made a robot / that finds haiku on Twitter / made by accident
Romanticizing/stitches in my head, I wish/I never started
bored boring boarded / the mind; the face; the palm; silence / i'm finding nothing
He died in my arms/ on his wife's birthday. She kissed/ Periwinkle lips.

The wind thuds and/ Whistles against my window./ The spring rain will follow./

Dust motes drift and glint / My heart considers your words / I regret my past
Spread out on the sheets / I reach out my hand to you / I've found my true love.
I sat at her feet / Rock upon which great men stood / Yellow flowers grew
Teach a man to fish / and he will drink too much beer / and forget to eat.
"i like your blue coat" / yeah, i liked all your clothes too / before you fucked her.
standing at the bar / eyes lock as he hits on her / are you kidding me.
Wanted to say "Hi" / Just now found this subreddit / Can I haz haiku?

The smoke bellows out / Behind dead winter trees / Screaming as it flows
You have gone stone cold / I just start a rock garden / And you go full bloom
murderous rampage / through bustling city streets / paused for a loo break
A river streams by / It whispers, so I cup some / Water in my hands
Air thick with burning / Ancient campfire brought inside / Hardwood smoke is sweet
View from the front porch the blue ocean straight ahead dunes, sand, waves, blue sky
How can you not see? / This mostly benefits me / I'll say anything
Flying through the air/miracle fish on violet wings/sails smoothly on wind currents
His touch ignites my / veins, tickles my thalamus./ "Coffee?" I'll pass thanks.
Love is perfection / It will blind you from the flaws / 'Til you see yourself
Cold beer waits for me/ a carrot on a long stick/ so close yet so far
Beat against a wall, / The brick won't provide redress./ Only bloodied fists.
People need to find / Their strength comes from the inside / Weakness shines too bright
Storm clouds form above / sleeping giant's frozen lips / a snoring brother
Many die in cold / frozen breath escapes their lips / brother snores again
For success and growth / reach the spirit deep within / see your efforts shine
Regret lingering / a great storm outside moving / ... why remain at home?
It's hard to find an / emo kid with a blood type / of B Positive
I know not what is / I am but too small to see / That is how I found
6:00 A.M.: / Why the hell am I still up? / Damn insomnia!
Slowly but surely, / Sun is breaking through the clouds. / Hope will light the way.
I tried lying down / Sleep just wasn't an option / Time to browse Reddit
A new year without/ you here is the loneliest/ I've ever been pissed
Shrubs grow in the ground/ surrounded only by death/ roots stop at 6 feet
Aphids draw ladies / Lady bugs draw their own pests / Nature knows balance
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
What road should I take? / I want it to be easy / But I can not know
Butterfly wings flap / trigger hurricanes afar / what do dog tails do?
Butterfly flaps wings / triggers hurricane far away / what do dog tails do?
